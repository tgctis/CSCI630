"> Undercover filming in a Panorama documentary broadcast in 2014 revealed clear evidence of fraud in at least two testing centres, as students took the test, which is required as part of the student visa-renewal process.
>
> In one, the invigilator was seen reading out the answers to a multiple choice test, while in another, fake candidates arrived to take the test on behalf of those who were due to sit the exam, with the invigilators fully aware that the students were being assisted by paid proxies.
>
> There is no doubt that there was a well-organised cheating system operating in those centres when filming took place; what is less clear is how many people were involved in the fraud.
>
> The Panorama reporter showed the footage to May, then the home secretary, who commented: “What Panorama has uncovered is extremely important. It’s very shocking and I want to do something about it.”
>
> The Home Office cancelled the visas of tens of thousands of students who had taken the Toeic test, large numbers of whom protest that they did not cheat. More than 4,000 have left the country without an opportunity to prove their innocence, having been told that they could be arrested if they did not leave. Immigration enforcement officers visited the homes of more than 3,600 students, as the Home Office attempted to round up all those accused of cheating.
>
> Many of those who believe they have been wrongly targeted have asked for an opportunity to sit a new English test, pointing out that they had no need to cheat as they speak fluent English. Some were studying for degrees in English literature, others were PhD students, and some were nearing the end of accountancy and law degrees.
>
> Those who remained in the UK have been prevented from continuing to study and are unable to work while they attempt to prove their innocence. They are also unable to open bank accounts or rent properties. Many have had to rely on their families, who helped pay fees for their unfinished courses in the UK and are now funding their attempts to have their visas reinstated so that they can continue with their studies.
>
> The allegation of cheating in the UK makes applying to study elsewhere extremely difficult. Most chose to study in the UK because of Britain’s international reputation as a country with good universities and a reliable justice system. Because the Toeic issue has never become headline news, many say their families at home have begun to believe they must have cheated, convinced the UK government could not make such an error.",worldnews

Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, etc. determined that ""Democrat"" instead of ""Democratic"" makes them seem ever-so-slightly less appealing, as though they sound more like politicians and less like advocates of democracy, and thus use that term almost exclusively, despite that ""Democratic"" is the standard adjectival form.

"In speaking, ""democratic"" (little D) means ""they utilize democracy"". 

The GOP is democratic, as is the DNC. In theory any way. They utilize democracy (votes in representatives). 

You cannot distinguish by speech ""democratic"" and ""Democratic"". There's no difference when said aloud. 

Ergo ""Democrat party"" is used, because ""the Democratic party"" said aloud could insinuate that the GOP is *not* a piece of a democracy.

Nothing like that. ""Democrat"" is a party member. Period. Always has been. ""Leftist"" is pejorative, just like ""right wing"" is pejorative.

No I didn't.  I said:

And

>people who get the majority of their news from above hot airs of bag also subconsciously start using it

And

>it's part of a larger intentional trend among the far-right.

I at no point made any sort of statement implying the Independent was engaging in the same type of intentional demonization that Limbaugh, etc. engage in. Only that they used such a word and even directly stated it may be subconscious on their part and may even ""sometimes it may just be a slight mixup or something"".

-

I don't know what the Independent's editorial standards are. I don't know if it's common in the UK to use ""noun+leader"" to refer to the head of a political party or not.

Just as an example, googling 'site:nytimes.com ""democrat leader""' results in ~168 hits, and all of the hits on the first page refer to foreign political parties (""Germany's Social Democrat leader""). ""Democratic leader"" results in tens of thousands referring to US politics.",politics

Turn on Limbaugh or Hannity some time and you can see it yourself.

Uh, no. That's exactly what ""imply"" means. It's the intention of the author. e.g. if a reader infers information that was not implied by the author, that is the fault of the reader for poor reading ability and/or poor communication skills by the author.
