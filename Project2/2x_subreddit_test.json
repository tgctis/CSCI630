    "I think that the human brain has a deep need to have a meaningful narrative for everything. It must continue the story, and it must reconcile tragedy, joy, and unrelated events all the time. I feel like humans have a natural tendency toward religion. \n\nThere are some nasty, hideous things dine in the name of religion. On a less severe and maybe more insidious level, SOME religion tries to teach humans to all think alike and agree on a doctrine unquestioningly. However, you can see counters to this - Jewish people welcome questioning and I think Buddhist people do, too. \n\nBut there is something special about religion. I wish I could have this special thing, but I don't believe in a god, so I can't. And that is the community, ritual, and peace religion can bring. If you are a member of a religious community, members of the community will take care of you and your family during difficult times. You have a social network built into your life! I have recently been studying Judaism because every moment of a Jewish life has meaning and ritual incorporated. Every act you do is with mindfulness and intent. I think that is beautiful. I wish I believed I would see my loved ones when I die. I wish I believed I was immortal. I wish I could have that peace with death that a religious person has. \n\nI don't think religion is bad or evil. I just don't believe in any god or think a being created the universe. I think the bad aspects of religion are just bad aspects of human beings.",

Besides, the glitter would still be everywhere even if you moved the glitter from a counter to the floor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd truthfully, you never said what kind of glitter either.

I think people should be able to live as they see fit, but they shouldn't be misinformed. Being overweight is unhealthy, and nobody should be under any illusion to the contrary.

    "Joey Diaz is my hero. Something about his story just hits me in my core. He was a coke-addict, a felon, a Dad to a family that didn't want to see him, etc. He turned it all around and has been a stand-up for many years and has a few movie credits to his name. He's not the most famous person and he's not the most successful, but his attitude has single-handedly changed mine as well. Just from his podcast I've learned many things about standing up for myself, work ethic, and how to achieve life goals. I can honestly say I've learned more from Joey than I have from my own father (he's not a bad dad, just didn't teach me a lot of \"man\" things when I was younger). On the chance that he's reading this, thanks for practicing what you preach and teaching me what being a man really means.",

Boys are taught to bury their emotions and not let them take the wheel or let them enter into an argument while girls are allowed to be much more in tune with their emotions and that emotions are a valid thing to base an argument off of (like the glass on the counter). So when something like this is brought up men are generally going to not look for the emotional reasoning why their wife is upset about the glass on the counter and go straight to logical reasoning and find nothing worth being upset over. So when he then tries to get a reason why this upsets her and he only gets that she doesn\u2019t like it when he leaves a glass on the counter his mind is automatically dismissing that as a false reason since something that elicits this big an emotional response must have a valid logical reason to it, but what he finds is she won\u2019t tell him the valid reason and he just gets confused. In short she views her emotions as a valid reason for this argument/breakdown but he only views the logical \u201cI view it as disrespectful\u201d argument as reasonable, in the end the lack of communication about what the issue really is causes tension in the relationship as he either moves forward not having learned anything and keeps doing what she views as disrespectful or he learns to fear her emotional reactions to what he views as small things but puts his glass in the washer and still doesn\u2019t understand the underlying issue. Men are taught to fear big emotions and women are not.\n\n\nI wrote this part below first and almost deleted it as it\u2019s more aggressive than what I wrote above (which I think covers things more broadly) but I decided to leave it as it expresses some of my thoughts that are not above but again is a bit more aggressive than I like but I\u2019m at work and don\u2019t want to bother editing it on my phone lol:\n\n\nI think you missed a big point of the article: the issues that are being perceived by the wife are only issues to her but she doesn\u2019t explain why. ie her issues are not logical issues and don\u2019t really have a basis in reality besides her perceived disrespect (that she doesn\u2019t explain). If I have an issue with something my partner does I don\u2019t expect them to change that without a valid reason. Example I don\u2019t like that my partner doesn\u2019t push her chair in anywhere we go, do I make that into a big deal that I always push it in for her? No, why? Because if I ever bring it up she brushes it off as habit and no big deal. Should I break up with her over something so petty that I can solve in 2 seconds? Do I keep telling her every single time to push in her chair? No, because it really is not a big deal and I understand she just literally doesn\u2019t realize she does it and that\u2019s okay, she\u2019s not being passive aggressive and doing it to spite me or disrespect me, we\u2019re in a grown ass relationship and things this small aren\u2019t the hill I want to die on. She doesn\u2019t even have a valid logical reason to not push it in and I actually can name a couple reasons to do so but they are barely valid and again this is not the hill I want to die on, I\u2019m not going to pick a fight over not pushing a chair in. I have little things I don\u2019t like that my partner does but I\u2019m not viewing them as an active form of disrespect from her towards me and so I would never understand her brining up these little things to me as big deals because I would never do that to her, if it was a big enough issue I would explain why something bothers me so she understands my perspective and have a rational conversation, reaching the point of a breakdown and still not explaining why something bothers you isn\u2019t going to result in a productive result.\n\n\nYou seem to have only read the first half of the article but the bottom half addressed issues with how women are presenting these issues to men. I even quoted it at the end. The point I\u2019m trying to make is if every little thing is an issue that constantly gets brought up without a reason those issues won\u2019t be taken seriously because you\u2019ve given no reason besides what I would view as a massive overreaction (crying over not putting a glass in the washer).\n\n\n>\tSo, respecting your partners wishes only works if they specify that not listening to them is disrespectful? Also, its disrespectful for them to not specify that they're feeling disrespected. My head is spinning from the circles you're going around.\n\nDo you really expect your partner to do everything you say without a reason? But to directly address what you\u2019re saying: if my partner has a breakdown over a glass on the counter I am going to be doing my best to try to figure out what\u2019s really wrong because no one would actually have a breakdown over that without something else going on. Which it turns out is true, she is feeling disrespected by the glass on the counter but never explains that, so I wouldn\u2019t connect the two in my mind. Best case scenario is I would simply be putting glasses in the washer without understanding why and just waiting for something else to set off a breakdown since I don\u2019t know what was actually bothering her (is it something about the glass itself? Is she afraid of rings on the counter even though it\u2019s granite and the glass is empty? I wasn\u2019t even done with that glass so do I get a new one to avoid a blowout or is getting more dishes dirty a bad idea and going to set something else off?) which leads to fear of my partner blowing up at me not doing something because I love and care for them. This reminds me a lot of r/RaisedByNarcissists where you can\u2019t expect to get a reason for something you just do it to keep them happy. My parents were this way, did I remember to rinse my plate and put it in the dishwasher because my mom felt it was disrespectful to leave it in the sink for whoever was doing dishes that night? No I did it because I was afraid of the yelling and crying that would ensue if I didn\u2019t. \n\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is if you expect your partner to do something that doesn\u2019t have a logical reason but solely because otherwise you are going to have a small meltdown over it you aren\u2019t making them more respectful of you you\u2019re making them afraid of you and yes you are disrespecting them because you don\u2019t trust them with the real reason you are upset and are using emotional manipulation to get them to behave the way you want instead of them doing it out of respect or love.",

I would look online and estimate your total federal tax burden.

So if you decide you can spend $x per month on rent, maybe subtract a hundred or two to account for utilities.\n\nThe other thing you have to consider is that with few exceptions your rent will increase 3-5% every year. My last apartment complex tried to increase my rent 15% in one year. So if you want to increase the amount you are saving every year, you better hope your salary increases are more than your increase in rent each year.\n\nThat being said, if you really want to live in the nice apartment complexes with the amenities but also want to heed your parents\u2019 advice about saving money, have you considered getting a roommate? In most places it\u2019s not much more expensive to get a 2 bedroom than a one bedroom, and then you can split the rent and utilities in half. There are drawbacks to roommates but when you\u2019re young it\u2019s a good way to save money. \n\nAnyway good luck, and watch out for lifestyle creep.

I had a car but after being broken into 9x, stolen 2x and a homeless person sleeping inside, all because I park on the streets (given garage rental is $400 on average) I knew I had to consider being car-less.

    "Bold and decisive + informed.\n\nI think you should pick your number (the minimum you\u2019re willing to leave your current role, not 15%) and keep that in the back of your mind. \n\nStart by engaging the CEO on the budget for the position without showing your insider knowledge. \n\nSaying \u201cI really appreciate the offer at $X - with relation to competition in the market (blah, blah, something relevant about why they would pay more) is this the top of your budget and are you able to do better?\u201d \n\nIf he gives you a better number that\u2019s good.\n\nIf not, they might be trying to get a deal (sorta orange flag) and your offer may be somewhat contingent on you *being* the good deal, so at that point, I would share your number, saying:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about how excited I am to pursue this opportunity, and while it matches my XYZ goals for seeking a position separate from my current role, to make the switch, I would need the base level to be $Y - can you make that work?\u201d",

    "Insurance agent here. Look into getting a \"Named Operator\" policy. It's designed for people that don't own a vehicle but might occasionally drive one. More importantly it ensures you don't have a 2 year lapse in coverage that will make getting insurance again in the future stupid expensive.", 
    "I think the idea about the trial run is a good one. That said, I gotta tell you I recently found myself carless after driving for years and I\u2019ve actually found it sort of liberating. \n\nFirstly dropping gas, insurance, and maintenances expenses has freed up a pretty decent amount of money that I can save or use for others things.\n\nBut even past that, it\u2019s brought a certain organization to my day. I know it takes me half an hour to walk to work, no if\u2019s and\u2019s or but\u2019s. I can\u2019t leave the house late and speed to work, so I can\u2019t leave the house late. As a result I must wake up at a particular time, so on and so forth. Catch my drift? \n\nFor further expositions I take advantage of the public transit near me. I didn\u2019t grow up in a place with busses, and so I found it intimidating at first but after just a few day trips out (taking busses to points of interest and exploring different transfer options) I managed to get a general idea of how to get around when I want to. Take advantage of transfer passes or bus cards to keep things cheap (usually).\n\nThat said there are, of course, drawbacks. Grocery shopping stinks. Honestly shopping at all, though it can keep me from overspending on some trips (you can only carry so much\u2014 and it\u2019s not very much at all). I\u2019ll call a Lyft if I have a lot of stuff. \n\nThen there\u2019s weather. On temperate to cool days (my personal preference), it\u2019s honestly the best experience and will entirely make my day. I love walking under the warm sun when it\u2019s cool out. But when it rains, or it\u2019s awfully hot, all that stuff it\u2019s less than enjoyable. That falls under acceptance for me, and there\u2019s a certain satisfaction to taking the bad with the good, if you ask me. I appreciate the nice days much more. \n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve found myself pretty happy about not driving lately. There\u2019s a lot happening in the world around us, at all times. We miss a lot, sitting in boxes all day.", 
    "This is obviously not a good thing to do. But I wonder how those shady check cashing places deal with this type of fraud.", 
    "From the way the OP posted and the way he replied at the bottom I feel like this is a luxury item you can\u2019t afford and just are trying to seek justification. If you can\u2019t go to the store and pay for the phone outright you have no business financing it for 30 months. Also keep in mind that if you lose it you\u2019re on the hook for the full amount. Even if you pay for insurance you\u2019ll have a copay. I believe it\u2019s at least 300 bucks.\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying financing a phone is a bad thing, a lot of the programs offer 0% interest. I almost did this when I bought my phone. (Ended up not doing it because the only model they had in stock was the unlocked model, and the locked models are the ones subsidized by the phone company for 0% interest apparently and I didn\u2019t want to go back to the store so I just bought mine outright). But the way you\u2019re making it sound is you don\u2019t have a steady gig just yet, and at some point you may have to pay for an expensive phone or eat that month if something goes wrong. Not worth it. \n\nSeriously nobody cares if your phone is the 6s or the XS. And if they do they\u2019re a crappy person anyway.", 
    "So commit fraud?  yes you can do that.  If you stupid enough to commit fraud with somebody else's fraud then you might as well just rob a convenience store with a rubber chicken and go straight to jail.", 
    "I've never had to put references for an apt. That's a little weird.", 
    "Good advice thanks. I think I won't be revealing my knowing the full base and go along the lines of what you said. It would be a great career move in many ways but I can't help but feel like it's going to take me several years of raises to get up to the initial base and I don't want to be a discount guy.", 
    "I sold my car because my commute changed to something similar to yours. I bought a bike and haven't looked back. There are a few things that are def easier with a car i.e. grocery shopping, errands, etc. I hate asking my friends for rides so that has been the only frustrating thing. I now use instacart for grocery delivery and car2go any time i'm in a pinch. I def would recommend a trial period.", 
    "I'd say sell it, but don't put all the savings into an IRA. What I did when I moved to a city that I wouldn't need a car is I set myself a monthly rideshare/zipcar/public transport budget (in my case $300), and as long as I was under it I took the transportation I needed. That way I made sure not having a car didn't get in the way of the things I wanted to do. It sounds easy, but without context that $50-100 uber to some place you want to go kind of far away sounds ridiculous. But when you're under budget and still saving vs having a car it doesn't sound so bad. Most months I'd spend around $150.", 
    "My sister gave up her car as the bus to work was just as fast and a $90 monthly bus pass is so much better than the $400 car lease/ $120 insurance/ $250 gas every month. When ever she actually needs a car she uses one of the jiffy car things around town. Theres one just by her buildings front door. Its a by the hour car rental. Just use the app and the door unlocks and off you go. Usually its a Prius. Park it back in the spot or any of their spots when your done.", 
    "Seriously it\u2019s dumb fucking law that also fucks up school funding", 
    "Yeah everything else completely checks out, which is what makes it so weird... I\u2019ll be sure to triple check the lease they send over", 
    "If you're close enough to walk for grocery consider buying one of the little foldable shopping carts. I've never owned a car and love my little grocery cart! Made walking + getting groceries so much bette and I can actually buy a ton of stuff/drinks.\n\nIf you do a few trials using grocery delivery services, keep one of the amazon fresh bags, they fit in the standard wire foldable shopping cart perfectly.  \n\nWhen I lived further I would bike to the store, bring a backpack and stuff everything in the backpack. You can't buy bigger bulkier stuff or soda/drinks though. But it was workable. If I needed to buy a ton I would just uber home. Still cheaper than owning a car.", 
    "Going to a gym, rec center or bars for drinks are all great for meeting new people. IME, amenities in apartments are under utilized so don\u2019t get too attached to them. Start at the cheapest place you can until you pass probation. This job may not work out for various reasons and what happens then?\n\n\nYou\u2019re at the beginning of your career. Some smart choices here can set you up for life. Like getting a whole life insurance policy now, while healthy and cheap. I\u2019m 35 and have too many health issues to ever qualify anymore via a car accident.", 
    "I wouldn't sell it, it sounds like it will be paid off in about a year.  Your job may be close but that doesn't mean everything else is.  You will really limit where you go/what you can do.  You'll end up taking uber or renting a car which at that point you might as well have your own ride.",

    "It never ceases to amaze me how many people go into a dealership attempting to deceive the sales staff... and then turn around and try to talk shit about dishonest dealers. \n\nSeriously, they've done this before. They're not going to accidentally slip up and give you the car for half price.", 
    "My advice is to refinance the car, $480 is a lot of money. If you're positive on not using the car, return the plates to the DMV and cancel the insurance. You'll have to keep the car in your property. You could try converting your bike to electric to make trips to the grocery store and other places. Kits on ebay go for under $200.", 
    "Try Progressive or Geico. They're more geared towards high risk policy holders. State Farm quoted over double what they quoted, at least for me.",
