Puerto Rican politicians don’t control the island’s budget; that’s up to Congress. Puerto Rico is a part of the United States: The people who live on the island are citizens who pay taxes, even though they don’t have voting representation in Congress. And the people of Puerto Rico did not actually receive $91 billion in federal aid after the hurricane. Since Hurricane Maria struck in 2018, the federal government spent $11.2 billion to help rebuild the island. The $91 billion figure estimates the island’s total liabilities, according to a Post fact-check. Trump’s statement is a bald-faced lie.

I have a close lifelong friend who is a blacksmith. For a few years he lived in an apartment house I owned. Sometimes. He had a forge in the yard and a machine shop in my storage building. He sometimes (quite often) had trouble making rent, so he would do all kinds of odd jobs for me. Cutting and welding and grinding various shit, lifting really heavy things, you name it. Whenever he was in production mode making weapons (like in the months leading up to ren fairs or SCA wars when all the live steel idiots buy their blades) he would make a piece for me. I could sell some of these blades for hundreds of dollars, a few upwards of $1000. These are not ""mall store"" blades or theatre props. 

I treat them as the heirlooms they are, and would never sell one or even display them. (I have a pot rack in my kitchen with his signature style, a few art pieces, and a dagger that I sometimes use as a costume piece) but the swords are personal, kept private, and not shared with anyone for the same reason my guns remain stored. These are legitimate weapons, no matter what kind of joke people would make of them. They have solid tangs and, aside from the neglect of being stored for so long, quite respectable edges. If a hardware store hatchet could take your hand off, one of these blades could do it quicker.

I mean, it may surprise you to learn this, but the sort of people who put on masks and go out looking for fights at protests aren't exactly the perfect moral paragons you might want to believe.

FWIW, the Competitive Plan would have given Trump exactly 270 Electors in 2016, thus he would have won by the smallest Electoral College margin possible.

Any scheme which retains the Electoral College would necessarily discount the nationwide popular vote. If the goal is direct popular election of the President, then scrapping the Electoral College is the only option.

Besides, the proposed Competitive Plan would require state by state approval due to Article II, Section 1, paragraph 2 giving state legislatures exclusive authority to determine how Electors are selected. Congress has no power or authority to impose any scheme nationwide. Good luck getting all 50 states + DC to adopt this scheme.

All that said, ***plurality wins*** is unsatisfactory. Ranked choice or other automatic run-off schemes may be to complicated for many Americans' comfort.

A relatively small nuclear plant can generate 10,900 Gigawatt hours of electricity in one year with 0.07 sq. miles of land. That is less than a tenth of a square mile.  

The biggest solar plant in the country is about 5 square miles and only outputs a measly 1,664 Giga Watt hours. That’s 332.8 GWh per square mile.

Lets be generous and round up for nuclear. Call it one square mile, that includes the parking lot and other bullshit. That would still be 10,900 GWh per square mile. You would need about 33 square miles of solar panels to output one nuclear plant. 

The first Google search a result claims you would need 21,250 square miles to power the US. This is slightly smaller in size than the state of West Virginia. That isn’t even counting battery storage.

e5436ed26d6ed52b6f5fd16e73593d87,">It is axiomatic that Donald Trump has a gift for turning his  losses into wins simply by blaming the agent of the loss for thwarting  the will of “the people.” But in flipping the DOJ’s position in the ACA  litigation, he appears to be affirmatively courting losses in a way that  transcends even the most cynical Trumpian worldview. It’s entirely  possible that the reason this president has the highest loss rate in the  courts is because he actually banks on losing. Perhaps, it’s good for  him. The question is why?           
>  
>Surely Trump enjoys that he can—with each and every loss—continue to [attack the independent judiciary](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-nato-meeting-secretary-general-jens-stoltenberg-today-live-stream-updates-2019-04-02/), one of his favorite in-between-nap activities. It’s also true that if your entire brand is [fomenting crisis](https://truthout.org/articles/donald-trumps-only-strategy-is-to-create-crisis-and-claim-to-fix-it/),  the sudden loss of access to health care for millions of Americans  might be considered a big win. On the flip side, the ability to deflect  blame to the courts for his own political failures on health care could  also result in more claims of winning if things go the other way.           
>  
>**It’s not just that Trump’s principal brand is chaos, though.  It’s that his principal claim is “I alone can fix it.” He has shown,  time and again, a willingness to blame even putative allies if it serves  to position him as the sole savior—bread and butter stuff if you’re an  authoritarian who hates institutions.** When the Framers crafted the  three-way system of checks and balances, they assumed that any two  branches could promote stability by checking the third if it went off  the rails. Donald Trump has managed to invert that tripartite structure,  happily spreading the blame for government dysfunction among the other  two branches, instead of his own. The rule of three as the most stable  structure can be subverted to afford you double the scapegoats. **That is  his current play on the ACA, betting on the opportunity to use decisions  of the courts and the Congress as excuses for his failure to perform on  a central campaign promise. This will** ***always*** **be his play so long as allocating blame is more valuable to him than achieving any policy outcomes.** [**Cruelty itself is still emphatically the purpose**](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/) **of this president’s decision-making, but evading responsibility is the prime method.**

ac8ef2bd5152b4fa45d9f5c9f9053062,It's bigger than just the auto industry; what about triggering a recession?,politics
3bd9d91c2e74a633406442f682f01144,"The auto industry is one of the most important industries in the United States. It historically has contributed 3 – 3.5 percent to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The industry directly employs over 1.7 million people engaged in designing, engineering, manufacturing, and supplying parts and components to assemble, sell and service new motor vehicles. In addition, the industry is a huge consumer of goods and services from many other sectors, including raw materials, construction, machinery, legal, computers and semi-conductors, financial, advertising, and healthcare. The auto industry spends $16 to $18 billion every year on research and product development – 99 percent of which is funded by the industry itself. Due to the industry’s consumption of products from many other manufacturing sectors, it is a major driver of the 11.5% manufacturing contribution to GDP. Without the auto sector, it is difficult to imagine manufacturing surviving in this country.

Recently, the auto industry has fallen on tough times. However, the U.S. market is still one of the largest motor vehicle markets in the world; consequently, many automakers sell and manufacture in the U.S. In fact, many automakers make the lion’s share of their profits in North America. There has been a period of restructuring by the three U.S.-based companies in order to right-size their operations and be able to respond to this fierce competition in the U.S. market. In the latest restructuring, a bursting of the housing bubble and a collapse of the financial sector led to the current period of extremely tight credit, making it nearly impossible for companies and consumers to make investments. During this period, many supplier companies, dealerships and a couple of manufacturers found themselves fighting for survival and turning to the lender of last resort–the federal government. This led to an amazing time of public introspection concerning the value to the country of a U.S.-based auto industry.

The level of non sequitur is astounding. I was recommending Yang because he's the only one that can be trusted (and is informed enough) to adequately address the problem. A more apt analogy would be majority the students failing a particular course, and someone who's not a teacher but is an expert on that course is invited to teach them the course so that they can pass their final exams.  
  
>I believe that Harris and Buttigieg have both talked about automation.
  
See magnitude of the problem and urgency of solutions required. Yang gets the problem, he truly understands it. In this particular area, he's an expert. Furthermore, he's passionate about him. A Yang presidency will see the problem dealt with, while the same cannot be said for Harris or Buttigieg.

I think automation is coming in different forms, speed, and in Essence some is already here.   and I think you are not as far off in your statements.    I have a 17 year old learning how to code C++ for free by going thru tutorials in the internet.   One of the largest and popular app in China connects their students who learn English with Teachers in Canada and the US.   So yeah your bus driver may just hand out and collect the test ( a bit jokingly of course).   So if you breakdown teaching into knowledge and social behaviour, well the knowledge exists, social behaviour and interacting with others unfortunately that’s also being taken over by social media app.  Teachers and parents are having less influence with our students than before soc media in my opinion.

Banking we are going for exception handling and AI to make 99% of decisions and transactions not touched by human hands, these are not the tellers but the people processing loans, and paperwork the back office.    This is in the now.   The CEO of these banks are forecasting and aiming 40 to 50 of these jobs will be lost.  And yes I am already part of the guys creating the platform. 

To your point about surgeons.  Remotely operations has been tested, and will only get better with 5G. First remote then yeah. LASIK I think is done automatically?

Also, sadly we have much bigger more important priorities to fix first - healthcare and criminal justice systems are fucking over our citizens every dam day.",politics

1de30b902e7cc8747f5fafb65a47a541,Based on this comment it sounds like a better suited president should open up a division focused on tackling automation and how we need to adjust for it and put Yang in charge of that one division.

d13f40d98694ade2ee6ff96d153fe9ac,"I said that Yang should get actual political experience first. You disregarded this and went off on how it doesn’t matter because of the next labor revolution (i.e. automation). I’m talking specifically about your argument for why Yang, somebody with no political experience, is *more* qualified to be president *than people with actual political experience.* To me, this is no different than arguing anybody should be able to operate on your sick child because the surgeons of the future could very well be robots. Your analogy in your previous comment (an expert helping a class pass their exams) is basically the same argument, if not more absurd, than when people argue a businessman should be in the White House/the country should be operated like a business.

Yes, automation is a big issue, and will be an even larger issue in the not-too-distant future, but we have *a shit ton* of more pressing, imminent issues to deal with *now*, issues that will require somebody with at least *some* political savviness and expertise.",politics

Hell, today I saw a topic on r/personal finance today where a person lost their position at an insurance company to automation.

Do we have other large concerns? Of course. Unfortunately I don't believe we're in a position to be able to triage these things. We have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.

I really hope Bernie embraces UBI. He's so close to being in line with most of the positions I want... but he isn't there yet. Currently I'm leaning towards supporting whoever I perceive as having the best chance at winning in 2020 against Trump, but I could be convinced to vote for who I think would make the best candidate, but they REALLY have to be willing to push these ideas hard.",politics

It all comes from the same train if thought, they are so far into the Foxhole that the reality that they see is that different. This is not a misunderstanding, this is a full belief that the situation is different and it has been preached on Fox. 

The world is so spun for them that they are fighting the ""socialism"" of healthcare because Fox ran stories that [California would extend medicaid coverage to *""the illegals""*](https://insider.foxnews.com/2018/05/22/california-bill-offers-health-care-illegal-immigrants-antonio-sabato-jr-reacts)

He does this deliberately, you rile people up or get them to believe something. Wait just a little bit and get rid of it, the people who already took their marching orders are not looking back to check and see if he removed or altered his opinion.

This is textbook what Fox does all the time, say something divisive and emotionally charged - wait until people are charged, retract the article or remove it completely.

The damage is already done, and then if something later on happens to actually come out about the subject that is the opposite of what was said at the start - they don't care because ""they are doing it on the other side"" when in reality, the ""other side"" never said anything, ""news"" just said they did something and then removed it after everyone formed their opinions.

*This is why whataboutism is so dangerous* because you are making false equivalents, saying one wrong makes another wrong ok - and then throwing Fox narratives into the mix that they change up, delete or modify constantly.

I think for a majority of these people, they came to the conclusion of high school, or maybe even some junior college, and they're just *unprepared* for life as an adult.  

High school didn't teach them to face the fact that the jobs their parents, their grandparents had are no longer able, nor available, to provide them with any hope for future growth, or even life satisfaction.  These are probably individuals that don't feel that college is the right answer for them, currently, if ever, just based on price of admission and ""right fit"" for academics.

So there's a large group of men for whom The American Dream&trade; has begun ignoring and feigning invisibility in larger and larger numbers.  And what about opportunities for relationships?

Who are the young women selecting for dating and marriage?  What are parents of young women telling their daughters for who to date, court, and marry?  A bowling pin-setter, or a college-educated insurance salesman?  A mechanic or engineer?

I think that the Right took a strong point of bringing empathy to this group of males.  They weaponized that empathy immediately, but they acknowledged the problem for these men.  

When there's messages about how 70% of Americans cannot afford to buy homes, about the rising cost of student loans, and the lack of opportunities beyond being a wage-slave for 40 years, only to have health problems *not* be covered well by insurance, coupled with a lack of dating options, lack of access to nice/pleasant/enjoyable consumer goods, it's not surprising to see a large group of frustrated young men.  

And the democrats, regardless of their attempts to empower and enrich these young men, are also working tirelessly to empower minorities and impoverished, of which minorities also are a large percentage.  The Right has no problem distorting the issue to portray that minorities, infirm, and poor are being told they *shall* have a voice at Washington, *and their voice shall be heard first!*  As I said, I believe it's a manufactured distortion, but if you're a young man, without *opportunities,* feeling ignored by the ladies, the government, the community, and the boss, then the first person to say ""I hear you"" is going to have first crack at recruiting these people for their team.  That team was Bannon's team.

I'm sure I haven't been precise here.  I'm sure there's points I didn't bring up that deserve attention, too.  I'm trying to start a dialog, amongst people here on Reddit who's opinions I largely agree with (Dem leaning, I mean.)  

I think we need to understand them, and listen to them, and then see if they'll appreciate some problem-solving dialogue, rather than shaming, invalidating, and perpetuating a system that already set them up in an impossible future.

And if they want to be angry, and not listen still, well, then let's have a problem-solving dialogue about that.

Yes, unemployment is low, but that only counts a very specific group of people. A much more accurate form which counts everyone over 15 is labor force participation rate, which is currently around 62% which, for comparison, is around the rates of el salvador and guatemala.



of course people not working isn't *inherently* bad but out of those 40%, there's many, many people that want a job and can't get one, and even out of those who are employed, they often have work unrelated to their skills or education (underemployment).

I can see why those ideas are attractive in the short term, but economic inequality, climate change, and industrial automation require real long term solutions.

Buttigieg has long term ideas and seems to be taking time fleshing out policies with careful deliberation instead of pushing hamfisted short term ideas to put a bandaid on long term problems. I would rather a candidate take the time to think this stuff through and build a coalition than to offer such simple fixes. We don't need quick fixes. We need long term solutions.

a48d916323251736f83c9e717d70f15e,"> A VAT is inherently regressive. 

Not when combined with UBI. Thats the point I am making. With Yangs plan, you don't get one without the other. With a VAT of 10% and a monthly UBI of 1000 bucks, you would have to spend at least 10,000 bucks a month to be worse off due to the VAT. With VAT+UBI, the rich pay more and the poor/middle class get more.

Also, there is no reason it should be particularly inflationary since the program is not printing new money, simply redistributing wealth from corporate supply chains to the population as a whole. Prices would be likley to rise slightly, but lower to middle income people would still be way better off than they are in the current economy

They have a 0-15% success rate. There is a reason LEaRN TO CoDe is a meme. Turns out 40-55 year old coal miners and truck drivers are not particularly well suited to starting new careers as software engineers. As Yang says ""they didn't like school 20 years ago, why would they like it now?""

2be92cabda24d4ae99ba4ab3b73d5a0d,">Washington, D.C. (Apr. 2, 2019)—Today, the Committee on Oversight and Reform voted to authorize Chairman Elijah E. Cummings to issue a subpoena for testimony to President Trump’s former White House Personnel Security Director and three additional subpoenas relating to the Trump Administration’s secret efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.  One Republican Committee Member voted in favor of the census-related subpoenas.

>Cummings has now served all four subpoenas. 

>**Security Clearance Subpoena**

>Chairman Cummings made the following statement after today’s vote on the security clearance subpoena:

>>*“Today, the Oversight Committee voted to issue a subpoena for testimony from President Trump’s former Director of White House Personnel Security after being stonewalled over the past three months.  We have been informed of grave breaches of national security, but to date the White House has not produced a single piece of paper or a single witness requested by the Committee.  I hope this is the last subpoena we need to issue on this topic and that the White House agrees to cooperate, to schedule interviews for the next four officials we want to interview, and to turn over the documents we have been seeking for months.  I am heartened that at least some Republicans joined us in pledging their support for Tricia Newbold in order to protect her rights as a whistleblower who has come to Congress to highlight the grave abuses she has been witnessing over the past two years.”*

>Yesterday, Chairman Cummings sent a memo to all Committee Members providing information from a detailed, on-the-record interview with whistleblower Tricia Newbold, who currently works in the White House.  She came forward at great personal risk to warn Congress—and the nation—about the grave security risks she has been witnessing first-hand over the past two years.  She implored the Committee to act now, warning that “this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office.”

>On four occasions—January 23, 2019, February 11, 2019,  March 1, 2019, and March 18, 2019—the Committee requested a voluntary interview with Mr. Kline.  Mr. Kline never responded, and the White House refused to make him available.

>Yesterday—after the whistleblower’s claims were made public, and less than 24 hours before today’s subpoena mark up—the Committee received last-minute letters from Mr. Kline’s lawyer and the White House saying he would voluntarily comply.  However, they made clear that he would not answer questions about specific officials, specific security violations, or specific security clearance adjudications, but instead would speak only about general policies and procedures. 

>**Census Subpoenas**

>Chairman Cummings issued the following statement after today’s bipartisan vote on the three census subpoenas:

>>*“The Committee is trying to determine the real reason Secretary Ross added the citizenship question, and the documents and testimony covered by these subpoenas are critical to answering that question.  We don’t want thousands of pieces of paper that are already public or extensively redacted.  We want the specific priority documents we asked for—unredacted and in full.  We have bent over backwards to try to work with the Administration.  We identified priority documents, we extended deadlines, and we even offered to review certain documents in camera.  But the Trump Administration’s stonewalling has left the Committee no choice but to obtain this information by compulsory process.”*

>The Committee approved, by a vote of 23 to 14, a resolution to authorize Chairman Cummings to issue three subpoenas:  (1) to Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore for testimony; (2) to Attorney General William P. Barr for documents; and (3) to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. for documents.

>All Democratic Members voted to authorize the subpoena, and they were joined by Republican Committee Member Justin Amash.

>According to Committee Rules, Chairman Cummings may issue subpoenas on his own, but he chose instead to consult with Ranking Member Jim Jordan in advance.  Ranking Member Jordan objected and requested a Committee vote, which Cummings agreed to—something Republicans never did over the last eight years. ",politics

When you are trying to prove your case (to a court potentially in the future), you want to show that you were even handed and measured in your investigation. 

Asking nicely and giving them time to produce the documents that they asked for proves to the court that this was not a partisan attack, but an act of responsible and reasoned oversight. 

So now that the subpoenas are being issued, the Democratic Party has even more weight in a potential court case that might be coming up. 

The Republican Party can try to claim bias and partisanship, but the Democratic Party did it by the book.

As tasty as that sounds, it's not going to happen.

Congressional leaders will seek intervention by the courts. The question will not be so much about contempt of Congress and forcing a witness to appear, but more the question of whether the letter of the law allows Barr to withhold the report from Congress (28 CFR § 600.9).

They probably do rule that it does, and also that Barr must appear in order to say under oath that it does.

The bottom line is that if Barr doesn't choose to share the report with Congress, it won't be.

I hope he appears voluntarily, and I hope that somehow the parts of the report that he reveals to Congress contain some information that Trump and his minions didn't realize was incriminating, but is.

That's really what I'm hoping for -- Barr and Trump convincing themselves that their redactions are good, and missing something subtle that completes some picture that the committee knows about but we don't. 

Then they get Mueller in to talk about the details of this revelation, something that's not covered by the confidentiality of the report because it's an apparently separate, innocuous matter that surprisingly (to us and to the Republicans) puts impeachment right on the table (even for them).

It's not a small problem that he's being subpoenaed to disclose a document that according to the letter of the law is entirely confidential. Barr can make a case that the subpoena seeks to compel disclosure in bad faith, and he could reasonably ask for judicial intervention.

A disinterested point of view must weigh the confidentiality guarantee in 28 CFR § 600.9
against the power of Congress to demand disclosure.

If subpoenaed, Barr is obligated to *appear* but he obviously has reason to believe that the committee will attempt to coerce disclosure of a report that the letter of the law says is confidential (and doesn't say anything about him having to report to Congress).

This is rather similar to looking for evidence of intrusions when you don't even keep access logs -- if you do this, you haven't bothered to take minimal steps to detect a problem.   If somebody's voting in the names of people who have moved away, for instance, those ex-residents are probably *not* going to bother checking to see whether anybody's done so, and even if some enterprising investigative journalist requests public records and figures it after the fact -- it's too late to figure out which specific votes were cast improperly, so there's no mitigation possible after the fact.

Two, *not all elections involve millions*.  There are plenty of local elections which may matter *a lot* to interested parties.  Rent control, for instance; land use policies; school board elections; whether or not to have charter schools in a district -- these are not national matters.  These are very local contests, and can be very close.  In local elections, even a hundred votes might matter.  In a recent cycle, for instance, fewer than 60 votes would have changed the composition of a school board for a district near me (and not a terribly tiny district, with over 11K students and over 37K votes cast in that contest).

Three, when it turns out that there is a plausibly very close contest coming up -- it's *too late* to suddenly start worrying about security.    Deciding that there's a potential problem and doing a one-time massive surprise purge is going to be a lot more problematic than having a regular process that's been in place for decades and isn't demanding anything remotely novel of the electorate.

>she was discovered to be socializing with and contributing to the Alt-Right.

This is a smear perpetuated by a hostile establishment and the alt. right themselves who attempted to recruit her. She is a anarchist leftist who actively participates in movements against the alt. right. - they hate her. 

I'm just copying and pasting the below because I really care about this, but it's draining to talk about:

Her actual observable advocacy has been completely anti-far right. She's [colaberated](https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/977538175114588160) with Natalie Wynn aka Contrapoints who Vice called a ""[... trans youtube star destroying the alt-right](https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/a3ad7k/contrapoints-this-trans-youtube-star-is-destroying-the-alt-right)."" Contra has also been featured for her work in [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-stylish-socialist-who-is-trying-to-save-youtube-from-alt-right-domination) and [Verge](https://www.theverge.com/tech/2018/8/24/17689090/contrapoints-youtube-natalie-wynn).

Chelsea also appeared on [HBomberguy's charity stream](https://youtu.be/_mvYUaZYtJk?t=35) (another leftist anti-right wing YouTuber) for transgender children, and convinced AOC to go on it too. [Forbes said](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2019/03/24/5-fantastic-youtubers-fighting-the-spread-of-alt-right-propaganda/#2d3385363f53) ""Hbomberguy understands internet culture better than most, and sees the malicious intent behind the ironic racism and memes of the alt-right, the hate disguised as humor.""

“Fuck that. That’s Nixonian era reasoning. And whaddaya know, here we are with some of the same cast of characters from that era shielding their new fascist in chief. It’s time the people of this country took action and fought for what’s right instead of doing the easy thing and letting these cancers fester. As it is now the rich control it all. That’s what this fight is truly about and has been for a long time. These other issues are all just  dividing us all into our racial, religious, and other sub groups keeping us from uniting against the true common enemy. There are two systems of justice in this country. One for rich and one for poor. Two differing systems of health care. Those with it and those bankrupt without it. Two systems of education. The ones with free rides and the others shackled with student loans. On and on and on. This fight on the surface isn’t just about Trump. It isn’t even about Republican vs Democrat, although both sides are not the same. This fight in its purest essence is about what this country was founded on and what this country will be from this moment forward. It’s about restoring the power back to the people and rescuing democracy from the grasp of treasonous traitors strangling the life out of lady liberty. It’s not gonna be a short or easy fight.

“A number of speaking engagements, including these, were scheduled and confirmed prior to my election, swearing-in, and instruction on Minnesota House rules. In the transition, we didn’t realize that we would need to look back and apply these rules to previously confirmed engagements,” Omar said. “It’s regrettable that Rep. Drazkowski didn’t approach me directly with his concern so I could address this oversight. To address this concern, these honoraria will be returned to the institutions through their scholarship funds as soon as possible.”

Say what you will about Biden, and frankly I’m leaning pretty strongly against voting for him at this point.

But this paragraph by the NYT was simply *unconscionable*. Trump didn’t admit to merely grabbing women. He admitted to grabbing them *by their genitals*.

It is unconscionable that NYT characterized Trump’s behavior merely as “grabbing women without their consent” shortly after quoting Steinem suggesting Biden and other pols “ask before they hug” women.  It makes both behaviors sound the same and forms a false equivalency.

Based in Washington, D.C., The Washington Times was founded by **a self-professed messiah, Korean Sun Myung Moon** and according to its parent company, during Washington Times 20th anniversary, Moon said: “The Washington Times is responsible to let the American people know about God” and “The Washington Times will become the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world.”

>Operations Holdings Inc is the owner of The Washington Times, which is owned by the Unification Church of South Korea, through their holding company HSA-UWC (Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity). In 1954, Reverend Sun Myung Moon founded this religious movement in South Korea, which is known for its mass weddings and its members are referred to as “Moonies.” According to a Guardian article, former members have claimed that the Unification Church is a religious cult that utilizes brainwashing techniques. The newspaper is funded through a subscription and advertising model.

e050221935a4c7ffbb7c51daf34634ce,"The frustration Dana Milbank has concerning the rise of Bernie Sanders is understood. Sanders threatens the livelihoods of himself, his boss, his boss' boss, Bezos, wherever he stands in the echelon, and the hit-piece manufacturing facility he works at that someone thought was an authentic journalist institution. Milbank and the Establishment fail to understand that populism has taken over. Trump was honest in his campaign and managed to defeat seasoned GOP politicians because his message resonated with people, and therein lies the main difference between Trump and Sanders. 

One is a true conman, and the other is a true progressive. Both rely on populist messaging to catapult them to victory, however only Sanders has the history, bravery, and patience to fight for his policies. Trump will have a political stance on one issue at 3am, be against it at breakfast, wonder on it 5 min after, and then have the last person in the room ultimately convince him on where to align on said stance before 9am. Bernie's message hasn't changed since he obtained his senate seat. Although both Sanders and Trump are able to fill stadiums, their audiences, purpose, and political agendas are very different. Comparing both of them  as political juggernauts should be the signal to the end of establishment governing. There is no more middle anymore. Any candidate who believes in ""working across the aisle"" (*usually a D*), not catering to his/her base, and elating the elite will not be POTUS. Milbanks and his establishment cohorts' days in power are numbered and no hit-piece or breakfast cereal can change that. ",politics

Can you explain why you believe that? As opposed to ideological purity being their highest goal, with winning secondary to that. 

If he gets the nomination I hope I'm in the minority among Dems and independents in how he comes across. He's got some good ideas, and I'm glad to see those ideas influencing the party, but as a campaigner he leaves me cold. I don't get the appeal, and just to be clear I mean the appeal of him as a campaigner. The appeal of his ideas is easy to see -- but then again, I've got no problem with the ""socialist"" label in the Democratic sense, and I doubt that's true for a lot of swing voters. 

As a president I think he'd be ineffective, especially if the Reps hold the Senate. Given his age we'd probably be giving up the incumbent advantage in 2024, which seems like a dumb thing to do for no good reason. That's if he can win, which I don't see a good case for.

&nbsp;

What if I told you I think we're far behind where we should be as a country, Dem or Rep.

&nbsp;

I think we could take a major metropolis (Los Angeles) and turn it into not only a carbon neutral city but a carbon negative city and create enough renewable energy to sell our excess as a surplus with benefits to all that live in the city (opens the potential to have electric cars pull energy straight from a power grid in the road - cool technology like that).

I think we could utilize that to bring a new wave of technology around it, we need so many innovations and creations (how are we going to get electric firetrucks, electric farming equipment, electric ambulances, electric garbage trucks, electric shipping yards and boats etc) that we could create an entire industry as a city and then sell that technology to the rest of the world after creating and innovating.

If universal income is a desire, you could utilize this to your advantage - create universal incomes, but they have a purpose: You are innovating constantly, everyone gets paid to use and live in your innovations. They give you feedback and help advance the technology as well as test durability (you could even give a bonus to anyone who gives feedback that directly changes a product, an incentive to do more above getting a check.) This further drives innovation and creativity. 

The most ideal solution for automation is that you have the people who has a job that is better suited for automation, work with the  creators of the automation so that it is done properly - and in return, they learn how to maintain the new automation systems, help improve the productivity, and have a job on the other side of it. So anyone past the basic universal income that wants to work can help go down this road, help develop the new products and get paid above the universal income for doing so. We have to allow for social mobility in our country.

&nbsp;

For me , when people say we have just a ""gun"" problem I think it is far too short sighted of a discussion and you are doing yourself a disservice doing so.

It is a gun problem, a gang problem, a mental health problem, a drug problem, a homelessness problem and a police brutality problem.

If you do not fix all of those together, you will never make meaningful progress on any of them.

Any single one of these problems cannot be solved without the others because they give excuses for the others existence.

""Hey can we work out something with guns""

""For what? so that the only people with guns are the criminals and cops who keep shooting minorities?""

Or

""We need to get rid of gang violence in this country""

""Gangs exist in this country because of the illegal drug trade, they make so much money that they end up resorting to violence to protect that.""

These are common excuses for not resolving one of these issues is always another one of these issues, due to that they are all linked as one problem.

&nbsp;

And I think universal healthcare is a must, as well as legal immigration - it only strengthens a population, the only question I have for anyone who disagree is *what are you afraid of?* Either you are convinced of something that isn't real, or we should work on helping build your work skill set, because I know you aren't actually complaining that someone is taking your job picking avocados in the desert, that you so desperately wanted.",politics

Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment.* It would make no sense to go through this investigation and not let anyone but Barr see it. Zero sense.

8f0d0f44c3569650c372ea942597fdac,">Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump -- who has previously issued baseless claims about ballot-counting and voter fraud -- warned House Republicans on Tuesday night to be ""more paranoid"" about vote tallies.
Shortly after taking the stage at the National Republican Congressional Committee's spring dinner, Trump said, ""We've got to watch those vote tallies,"" and implied, without citing a specific example, that close races had been wrongly decided for Democrats.
""I don't like the way the votes are being tallied,"" Trump said. ""I don't like it, and you don't like it either. You just don't want to say it because you're afraid of the press. You're afraid of the press.""

>While Trump's references on Tuesday night were not specific, he claimed corruption and fraud last year in Florida and Arizona elections, where close races took considerable time to resolve. His claims at the time were debunked, and in Florida, GOP Sen. Rick Scott ultimately unseated the incumbent Democrat.
Trump's call for fellow Republicans to join him in paranoia about vote counts likewise echoed his debunked claims about widespread voter fraud in the US. He claimed multiple times after the 2016 election that millions of illegal votes in California had cost him the popular vote and that voters were bused into New Hampshire from Massachusetts.
As President, Trump has continued to claim that there is widespread voter fraud. He established a commission on the issue, only to dissolve it amid repeated controversy. ",politics
