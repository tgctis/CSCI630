    "My mum. She\u2019s a bad ass single mum who works her ass off to make sure we\u2019re always okay. She fought tooth and nail to give us every opportunity we\u2019ve ever had, even when our dad didn\u2019t give a fuck and didn\u2019t see the point in any of it. She\u2019s taught me a hell of a lot about the mother I\u2019d like to be and the husband I eventually want.\n\nMy brother would probably say me though because I saved him from drowning when he was 2. No good deed goes unpunished though because I had a broken arm at the time and 8 year old me was so annoyed the whole time my cast was wet \ud83d\ude02", 
    "Give it time, because even if you live somewhere that it has been legalized, it doesn't mean it's been *normalized*.\n\nThere is still a whole lot of social stigma attatched and it will likely be quite a while before it becomes mainstream.", 
    "My grandmother. She protected me, at least as much as possible, from my insane, abusive parents.", 
    "Alright, I've been holding on to an amazing piece of Mr. Rodgers and Pittsburgh history, so I'm going to drop it here.\n\nI was at an event at WQED and my wife and I ended up talking with Pittsburgh legend Rick Sebek for a good 30 minutes. The event took place around Christmas and was on the same studio floor where Mr. Rodger's Neighborhood was filmed. The setting moved Rick to tell us this anecdote. \n\nThe episodes of Mr. Rodgers were filmed in blocks, with all the episodes for the week being filmed in one day. After filming the episodes for the week of Christmas, Fred would meander around the set every year, just hanging out while the crew cleaned up and began to filter out of the studio. After a good many people had left, Fred would meekly announce \"Are there any women left on the set?\" Once he was sure all the women were gone, he'd mosey over to the piano on set and sing and play a dirty Christmas song, I believe Rick said it was called \"I Want to Hang My Balls in Your Christmas Tree.\" It was an old bluesy tune, but I haven't been able to find a copy of it. \n\nHe did this every Christmas, and it became a bit of a legend at WQED. Some of the women swore that one year they'd hide on set and finally get to hear Fred's song, but I think he was too patient for them every year.\n\nI asked Rick if I could tell this story and he said it's fine, but basically gave me the Bill Murray response of \"No one will ever believe you.\" But considering it came from Mr. WQED himself, I believe it.", 
    "After sitting in morning traffic... probably the same as Thanos", 
    "You guys sorting my new, \u2018unburying\u2019 the comments are the real champs. I won\u2019t add it in the future. \n\nI guess I mostly just do it as preparation for myself, like telling myself \u2018you\u2019re gonna type this whole thing up and possibly no one will ever read it, but if you put it at the top that you don\u2019t expect anyone to see it, at least you won\u2019t feel let down later\u2019\n\nBut I see your point, and I apologize!",

    "There is a good chance that you\u2019re simply not recognising what normal is, especially if if you live in the US. Over 160 million people are overweight or obese and there\u2019s an increasing problem with acceptance, as being overweight is the new normal and people simply don\u2019t realise that they have a problem.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5601193/", 
    "Yes, I do suffer from those syndromes. This has been verified by the psychiatrist I been seeing for about a year and the psychologist I've been seeing almost as long. My psychologist in particular encourages me to not be ashamed of my emotions and to share them openly when I need to. It is important to lessen feelings of isolation and facilitate supportive dialogue. \n\nYour response to my sharing, as well as your seeming misunderstandings about what \"professional help\" actually means in this context (you seem to suggest that I am wasting my time by being on Reddit rather than in therapy 24/7? And you keep telling me to get \"professional help\" while plastering me with misguided diagnoses) indicates that you have limited empathy, a major symptom of a reduced emotional intelligence quotient. Of course I am not a doctor, nor do I know you, but your atypical social behavior is troubling to me. I would certainly not want to be in group therapy with someone behaving as you are. \n\nI encourage you on your journey to discover the root of your atypical social responses, as they can lead to difficulty maintaining relationships, poor job prospects, alcoholism, and depression. Good luck to you! I sincerely wish you the best. <3",

I would look online and estimate your total federal tax burden. I also wouldn\u2019t consider your bonus as guaranteed income, because if it was guaranteed it would just be part of your salary. \n\nAdditionally, some people recommend that you should consider your utilities as part of your \u201chousing\u201d expenses - so depending on how big of a place you rent and how well you can tolerate being cold/hot, your utilities might be several hundred dollars per month. So if you decide you can spend $x per month on rent, maybe subtract a hundred or two to account for utilities.\n\nThe other thing you have to consider is that with few exceptions your rent will increase 3-5% every year. My last apartment complex tried to increase my rent 15% in one year. So if you want to increase the amount you are saving every year, you better hope your salary increases are more than your increase in rent each year.\n\nThat being said, if you really want to live in the nice apartment complexes with the amenities but also want to heed your parents\u2019 advice about saving money, have you considered getting a roommate? In most places it\u2019s not much more expensive to get a 2 bedroom than a one bedroom, and then you can split the rent and utilities in half. There are drawbacks to roommates but when you\u2019re young it\u2019s a good way to save money. \n\nAnyway good luck, and watch out for lifestyle creep.

    "hey u/strawberry-blond I'd consider:  \n\\- commute to work via walk, bike or bus and how the season will play out for you (especially in the east coast with snowfall etc.)  \n\\- nearby car rentals (e.g. Zipcar or similar) as well as frequency of Car Share apps  \n\\- family or friends if they're accessible be it car rental or public commute.  \n\\- local / weekend plans if you consider going up north or south and how often you'll consider needing a car for it.\n\nI'm from SF, CA where it's 7x7 miles with public transport, rideshare and rentals. I had a car but after being broken into 9x, stolen 2x and a homeless person sleeping inside, all because I park on the streets (given garage rental is $400 on average) I knew I had to consider being car-less. And my commute to work is a 1hr walk or a 45 min straight shot bus line. All I was doing was playing musical chairs of moving my car early am before street sweeping and using it 1-2x a month when I drive out of town.\n\nThe downside for me honestly is the upfront cost and accessibility/comfort. By what I mean is let's say I visit family for the weekend or the holiday season, I would need to do long-term rental like Enterprise that would cost me $400 for a 3-day weekend, $900+ for a week. (Zipcar can only help me on 6-8hr day trips by the way). Along with that is outside SF city limits, the Bay Area/Northern California is primarily a commuter lifestyle as places are farther and have limited public transportation.\n\nIf you see yourself being planted in DC having a fun and full experience with minimal driving use, I think it's doable. It's creature comfort at best having a car.\n\nCheers and good luck.",

    "Bold and decisive + informed.\n\nI think you should pick your number (the minimum you\u2019re willing to leave your current role, not 15%) and keep that in the back of your mind. \n\nStart by engaging the CEO on the budget for the position without showing your insider knowledge. \n\nSaying \u201cI really appreciate the offer at $X - with relation to competition in the market (blah, blah, something relevant about why they would pay more) is this the top of your budget and are you able to do better?\u201d \n\nIf he gives you a better number that\u2019s good.\n\nIf not, they might be trying to get a deal (sorta orange flag) and your offer may be somewhat contingent on you *being* the good deal, so at that point, I would share your number, saying:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about how excited I am to pursue this opportunity, and while it matches my XYZ goals for seeking a position separate from my current role, to make the switch, I would need the base level to be $Y - can you make that work?\u201d", 
    "I think the idea about the trial run is a good one. That said, I gotta tell you I recently found myself carless after driving for years and I\u2019ve actually found it sort of liberating. \n\nFirstly dropping gas, insurance, and maintenances expenses has freed up a pretty decent amount of money that I can save or use for others things.\n\nBut even past that, it\u2019s brought a certain organization to my day. I know it takes me half an hour to walk to work, no if\u2019s and\u2019s or but\u2019s. I can\u2019t leave the house late and speed to work, so I can\u2019t leave the house late. As a result I must wake up at a particular time, so on and so forth. Catch my drift? \n\nFor further expositions I take advantage of the public transit near me. I didn\u2019t grow up in a place with busses, and so I found it intimidating at first but after just a few day trips out (taking busses to points of interest and exploring different transfer options) I managed to get a general idea of how to get around when I want to. Take advantage of transfer passes or bus cards to keep things cheap (usually).\n\nThat said there are, of course, drawbacks. Grocery shopping stinks. Honestly shopping at all, though it can keep me from overspending on some trips (you can only carry so much\u2014 and it\u2019s not very much at all). I\u2019ll call a Lyft if I have a lot of stuff. \n\nThen there\u2019s weather. On temperate to cool days (my personal preference), it\u2019s honestly the best experience and will entirely make my day. I love walking under the warm sun when it\u2019s cool out. But when it rains, or it\u2019s awfully hot, all that stuff it\u2019s less than enjoyable. That falls under acceptance for me, and there\u2019s a certain satisfaction to taking the bad with the good, if you ask me. I appreciate the nice days much more. \n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve found myself pretty happy about not driving lately. There\u2019s a lot happening in the world around us, at all times.

    "From the way the OP posted and the way he replied at the bottom I feel like this is a luxury item you can\u2019t afford and just are trying to seek justification. If you can\u2019t go to the store and pay for the phone outright you have no business financing it for 30 months. Also keep in mind that if you lose it you\u2019re on the hook for the full amount. Even if you pay for insurance you\u2019ll have a copay. I believe it\u2019s at least 300 bucks.\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying financing a phone is a bad thing, a lot of the programs offer 0% interest. I almost did this when I bought my phone. (Ended up not doing it because the only model they had in stock was the unlocked model, and the locked models are the ones subsidized by the phone company for 0% interest apparently and I didn\u2019t want to go back to the store so I just bought mine outright). But the way you\u2019re making it sound is you don\u2019t have a steady gig just yet, and at some point you may have to pay for an expensive phone or eat that month if something goes wrong. Not worth it. \n\nSeriously nobody cares if your phone is the 6s or the XS. And if they do they\u2019re a crappy person anyway.",

That way I made sure not having a car didn't get in the way of the things I wanted to do. It sounds easy, but without context that $50-100 uber to some place you want to go kind of far away sounds ridiculous.

There\u2019s more than one person in this comments section who has fallen for this scam and I have friends and family who have as well. This scam is only possible because banks are incapable of verifying whether an account actually has the money to cover the check, something that would take less than five minutes to do manually. Honestly I don\u2019t remember the last time I heard of someone using a check for a legitimate purpose other than giving banking details for direct deposit/withdrawal which, again, is easily done manually.", 
    "It's all about where you lived.  I had a car but when I was living in K-town and working downtown, I took the metro around almost everywhere (since work paid for the pass).  It was so much less stressful.\n\nBut I also had grocery store, etc. in walking distance from my apartment.", 
    "Don't think that saying applies here mate",

    "I don\u2019t think that one applies here.", 
    "First call your lender. Find out what the total payoff amount is. Also let them know you're going to sell, and ask some questions: \n\n* Do they have any special requirements for selling?\n* Will they accept a check directly from the buyer?  \n* When/How/To Whom will they release the title once the loan is paid off?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck with your state DMV:\n\n* Do they allow transfer of ownership and registration with no title? Most do. \n\nThe tricky part is getting a buyer to be willing to wait on the title after paying for the car. BE UP FRONT about the title situation with the buyer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can get someone to agree, and assuming the bank will take a direct payment from the buyer, you' have them write two checks: one to you, and one to the bank for the payoff amount. Then you'd both immediately go to the DMV to do whatever record updating is needed to remove your name from the registration, and replace it with the buyer's name.  THey may issue a temp plate while the title is being processed. From here, it's usually the buyer's responsibility to conclude title xfer, taxes, etc. \n\nIt really varies by state what is required, but it can be done.", 
    "Oh ok. I\u2019d make the minimum payment on your car loan and pay more on your credit cards (bad debt). It won\u2019t impact your credit score to make the minimum payments each month unlike a credit card. Keep the money in your savings, you never know what can happen in life.",

    "Not a fan of this strategy personally, I wouldn't say anything about talking to a friend and hearing what they were told the range is. Better to keep the information secret so it's to OP's advantage and they can make a case based on what they bring to the table as opposed to \"well why not just pay me the max you had budgeted\"? That's not a strong argument.", 
    "Those just shift the break even point. I promise you there'll be a point where it's financially sound to own a car over using Uber.", 
    "I would keep the car. A car makes life much easier. If you can afford the payment and it's not a huge burden I would drive it until it dies.", 
    "For the fun of it, though, get the check then call the bank identified to confirm.  You're only out time at that point.", 
    "Absolutely a scam. I almost fell for it. I deposited the fancy check that was mailed to me and then the person who hired me asked me to wire the money, so I asked for invoices and the person got super mad at me and threatened to take me to court for keeping money that didn\u2019t belong to me. The check obviously bounced and I got a $12 fee for it, but that\u2019s better than being out almost $3k", 
    "I don't know what either of those words mean. Non-dischargable and secured debt? Eli5?", 
    "Fellow DC person here living the car free life...\n\nBetween metro, zip car and Uber you absolutely don't need a car here.  I assume you're also paying for parking?  I rent out my space for $175 a month, and that alone pays for my Uber rides.\n\nIf you do decide to go car free, consider getting a non owner auto policy to cover you when renting or using Zipcar.  Auto insurers really Jack up your rate if you haven't had continuous auto insurance even when you don't own a car, and you don't want to explore what happens when you cause an accident and have state minimum liability insurance from the rental company.", 
    "Yes.", 
    "keep it. trust me keep it.", 
    "to me (depending on where you live), the heat/AC is a little over the top. a comfortable environment is worth it if it's an option. i buy bulk. i cook at home/try to not eat out too much, although i'm on the road a lot so that's tricky.\n\njust don't go over the top. save. but go out, take trips, buy drinks for your friends, see shows, etc. etc.\n\nthat's just my 2 cents. i missed things i wish i hadn't when i was younger because i was living off my extremely modest musician income.", 
    "How big is the company, and how is the salary? Is it a small company and $180k year VP role, large company $600k+ type of role?\n\nI'm pretty shocked they only offered you a 15% pay raise - at VP level the cost of switching companies is very high (you lose your network, which when you have 100's of people working under you if a HUGE loss, and you're dependent on relationships with other VPs to get shit done), and you have a lot of risk (VP's get fired quicker, and its harder to find a new job). It's not like in middle management where switching jobs is just sucking up increased stress for a few months as you get up to speed.", 
    "they are dangerous and expensive to insure and largely impractical as your only means of transportation", 
    "Why not? even with ocean gear most things \"breaks apart\" and can be consolidated pretty well.", 
    "Agreed. My point was just that everything all put together made it seem like a legit opportunity, based on the info in the show I saw.   The woman was not some dummy who didn't think...she was an educated person who still got taken because of how sophisticated the whole setup was. I think most of us still associate scams with the  \"Prince in Nigeria\" type emails, and aren't expecting to have to be suspect of job offers.  But the scammers are getting more creative and determined.",

    "Good assumption anyone who tells you to make financial decisions based on the assumption your income will go up is either selling you something or dumb as rocks.", 
    "Not looking a gift horse in the mouth is a saying that is more akin to \"beggars can't be choosers.\" To just take what you've been given and be happy with it, don't inspect the gift. \n\nIt doesn't really apply in \"if it's too good to be true then it probably is\" situations.",
