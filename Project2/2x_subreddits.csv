"> ""Trespassing upon a privately-owned vehicle parked on a public street to place a chalk mark to begin gathering information to ultimately impose a government sanction is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,"" Taylor's lawyer, Philip Ellison, said in a court filing reported by NPR.

> Ellison said that covertly marking a tire with chalk is not unlike police secretly putting a GPS on a car without a warrant, according to the Associated Press.

Fuckin' a.",politics
"This is kind of a cool example of a thing laypeople are often unaware of:

The fourth amendment protects against certain *ways* the government can obtain information, rather than protecting the information itself.  So, in this case, the police could easily have taken a photograph rather than used chalk, and it would have been entirely constitutional.  Even though the information is identical, the *means of obtaining it* is important.

Normal people (those who had the good sense not to go to law school) think about privacy as being tied to the importance of the information.  So the ""private"" message you send to your wife over Facebook about how she's going to dress tonight should be more protected than what your favorite movie is.  

But the fourth amendment doesn't care.  Your message to your wife went through the intermediary of Facebook, and so is subject to the third-party doctrine (neither you nor your wife would have a viable fourth amendment argument against it being obtained *through Facebook*).  Your favorite movie may be something you only ever wrote down on a word document on your encrypted computer and never sent to anyone.

This can also segue into ""why Edward Snowden is disingenuous when he argues that digital documents should be treated the same as physical documents"", since his problem with privacy law is that digital information *is* treated the same way as physical documents.  But I don't want to bore anyone.",politics

"This strikes me as problematic, because the court opinion seems to frown on the very idea of ""commences its search on vehicles that are parked legally without probable cause"".

shh. stop giving them ideas!,politics
"Most cities I've lived in have people just drive by with cameras/apps that take pictures of every license plate.  So chalk is about to be obsolete, this lawsuit will just make more cities upgrade.",politics
"It's more the physical interaction with the vehicle.  Intruding on the property constitutes a search, which is an extrapolation from *United States v. Jones*, 565 U.S. 400 (2012).

>without commencing a ""search"" on it in some way, either via chalk or a photograph.

A photograph wouldn't be a search.

Again, the physical trespass is the distinction.  From the opinion:

>The Supreme Court held that the government’s trespass upon an
effect—the vehicle—to obtain information related to the car’s movement was a search... As the district court properly found, this physical intrusion, regardless of how slight, constitutes common-law trespass.

In other words: if you touch the vehicle to obtain information about it, you've trespassed and thus searched.  If you take a photograph, no trespass, no search.

The fourth amendment is a weird thing, and the way laypeople think about ""searches"" (as in ""any attempt to find information"") doesn't help.  Fourth amendment jurisprudence doesn't care so much about the *information* so much as *how it's obtained*.",politics
"Take a picture of the street. Then a second picture of the street. If the car is still there, then you didn't illegally search that car specifically but the entire street... If just so happens that out of 10 cars 2 never moved from time stamp to time stamp, so those cars get tickets. This can be automatic using Google map technology and license plate reading. Everyone would of course love that.",politics
"Kicking around.  There haven't been a ton of these kinds of ""hey, I can explain this because it's an issue which confuses laypeople"" issues recently, the legal issues in the public eye tend more towards ""clear and horrific"" rather than ""esoteric and odd.""",politics
"> A photograph wouldn't be a search.

Perhaps not, but if that is true, then is there really no justification in the constitution for preventing the collection of license plate information to track the movement of persons via their cars? Or using photographs and facial recognition technology to track such movement?

This also brings up a separate issue, which is whether the government is actually *prevented* from providing certain services versus private companies. Would it be a physical trespass if a private parking lot owner adopted the chalking technique to call a tow truck for cars who had exceeded their privately dictated ""one hour limit""? 

This issue seems murky to me - especially considering that the 4th amendment is supposed to be against *unreasonable* search and seizure. Having your car's tire marked by a meter enforcement person hardly seems unreasonable since it is a way to detect whether you are abiding by the privilege extended to you of parking on the city street.",politics
">then is there really no justification in the constitution for preventing the collection of license plate information to track the movement of persons via their cars?

There's not, at least not a constitutional one.  There could be a statutory protection, but that's kind of a broader ""the fourth amendment is a floor rather than a ceiling"" issue,

>Or using photographs and facial recognition technology to track such movement?

*Some* commentators have argued for a ""mosaic theory"" of privacy (alluded to in a Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in *Jones*) where at some point the volume and detail of information obtainable even through methods not considered ""searches"" under the fourth amendment would in aggregate become a search.  But for as murky as you think the current rules are, that's a much murkier idea.

>Would it be a physical trespass if a private parking lot owner adopted the chalking technique to call a tow truck for cars who had exceeded their privately dictated ""one hour limit""?

At common-law, absent a functioning waiver from the driver that the use of that parking lot came with the ability to tow the car, probably.

But that raises separate issues of contract law, wholly divorced from the constitutional issue.  It's kind of the same way the government can't censor your speech, but reddit sure as hell can.

The government is more restricted in how it can interact with people's information than private parties.  It's also why you retain fourth amendment protections when you send something through USPS, but if you hand it to your buddy to deliver you don't.

>especially considering that the 4th amendment is supposed to be against unreasonable search and seizure. Having your car's tire marked by a meter enforcement person hardly seems unreasonable since it is a way to detect whether you are abiding by the privilege extended to you of parking on the city street.

""Reasonable"", much like ""search"", doesn't really mean the same thing in fourth amendment jurisprudence that it means to laypeople.  In order to create a workable standard which isn't just ""is this subjectively reasonable to the current judge(s) or Justices"", the courts begin with ""anything without a warrant is unreasonable"" and then have created specific exceptions.

“[W]e must begin with the basic rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by [a] judge or magistrate, are *per se* unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment— subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.” *United States v. Hockenberry*, 730 F.3d 645, 658 (6th Cir. 2013).

""[T]he burden is on those seeking the exemption to show the need for it.""  *United States v. Jeffers*, 342 U.S. 48, 51 (1951).

The majority of ""how did this not trigger a fourth amendment problem"" cases are resolved not at ""it was a search but it was reasonable"", but rather at ""it wasn't actually a search.""

>since it is a way to detect

Right, but that's not really a permissible use of a search.  The police aren't allowed to execute a search ""to detect"" whether a crime has occurred, that's kind of the whole point of the fourth amendment.",politics
