If he edits them inappropriately, or uses them to imply things that aren't true, you might be able to get them taken down, depending on the exact context.

Title: **What does an order to remand to a hearing officer mean?**

Original Post: 

> A little background, in August of 2018 my dad was arrested for a DUI while sober. He requested a breathalyzer twice and his request was denied. Anyways, going through the DMV and administrative hearings has been rough to say the least. The first DMV hearing officer was unable to open the dash cam video showing that there was no reason for a stop in the first place. We have appealed the decision and just got an order from the district court. The order reads: The court hereby remands the matter to the hearing officer to consider the dash camera video and to issue any supplemental findings and order consistent with C.R.S 42-2-126. Can anyone tell me what this means? Thanks!

I haven't previously because I (naively?) thought let's try to diffuse this situation not escalate it. But this is the last straw and I plan to call police every time.,legaladvice
"Stop talking to C entirely.

When your friends come to tell you what C told them, politely let them know that you'd appreciate if they didn't pass on any further messages from C, and that issues between the two of you are private and you'd appreciate if they respected that. Be prepared to enforce this boundary with your friends - by ending conversations with people who don't respect it, for example. Similarly, don't discuss C with anyone who knows her - pretend she doesn't exist, and reserve your conversations about her to private conversations with friends who don't know her and who are focussed on supporting you.

There is almost nothing the legal system can or will do for you in this situation. Allegations of theft _could_, in principle, be defamatory, but without any actual damages, it's unlikely legal action would amount to much. They also are not the kind of activity that will justify a restraining order, and C has not committed any crimes, so will not face jail time for what she's said about you.

She can't put you in jail. She's not the police. Filing false police reports is a crime, but if the police do decide they want to follow up on this idiocy, it would be a good idea to get a lawyer at that time. Right now, all you need to do is cut her out.",legaladvice
"She’s blocked on everything on my end. But she’s actively going through our mutual friends telling them I’m a compulsive liar and a stealer, etc. and they’re making me aware that she’s trying to do this.  And everyone she has said this to, has taken my side because they know I would never do anything like that.",legaladvice
"It's up to your friends to decide for themselves whether they believe her or not. It's up to you to manage boundaries with your friends about whether you're willing to discuss C's remarks with them. Friends who won't respect your boundaries on this are not being good friends, and you would be well within your rights to limit contact with them or step back from those friendships, if this is that important to you.

Given that everyone she's tried this on has taken your side, I would say that you don't have a lot to worry about on that front.

However, this kind of dispute is almost never a meaningful legal issue. The law does not exist to police assholes for being assholes, basically, and even though these remarks may be motivated lies, they almost certainly aren't crimes or anything you could sue over. It might become a legal issue if you experience a substantial loss (such as loss of your job) as a result, or if the police actually get involved over the alleged theft, but right now you have a social problem, not a legal one.",legaladvice

"I don't have enough time for a full answer, but I can provide guidance.

First, almost everything is spelled out in the Florida Statutes regarding what you can and must do.

You do not need to create a trust, nor should you.  Your job is to marshal up the assets of the estate, inventory them (SUPER IMPORTANT), maintain them if need be, pay off the debts with whatever monies are available, sell assets to pay off any remaining debts, and THEN to distribute everything left according to the law of intestacy (to your mother).  The goal is to CLOSE the estate as soon as possible.  Closing means there is nothing left.  There are no debts, liabilities, nor property left.

If your mother agrees, and if you are a single child and your mother has no other children from other relationships, and if she has no brothers or sisters, she could file a disclaimer of her inheritance interest, whereafter you could distribute the property to yourself.  That might simplify things.

Before you close the estate, per the statutes, you will have to file an accounting with the court showing what you did.  Don't skimp on this.  But it doesn't need to be overly complicated.  A spreadsheet showing what items existed, the amounts in bank accounts, what you sold stuff for, who you made payments to, etc. should be enough.

The court does not need to be involved, nor does it want to be involved, in the allocation or disbursement of assets.  As PR you are personally liable for any screw ups that occur.  If you screw up, someone else will bring that to the court's attention.

Something that is super important that you did not mention is notifying potential creditors.  There are two ways to do so in Florida and you should do BOTH because they provide for different cut off dates for claims against the estate and one provides a much more definite cut off than the other.  This is something the lawyer should assist you with.  ALSO, if you do not own a house and your mother wishes you to receive the property, talk to the lawyer about how to transfer the house to you.  It is possible to preserve the homestead exemption, although unlikely.  But you don't want to screw that up.

&#x200B;

Taxes should not be an issue.  BUT, if your mother is in assisted living she has probably already divested herself of significant assets so that medicare will pay for her ALF.  Her receiving assets has serious implications for that.

Also, don't forget, per the florida statutes, as the PR you are entitled to pay yourself for your work.  See the statute to see how much you can be paid.  Keep track of your time.",legaladvice
Wow. Back in my day 10-15 years ago we never ran that report unless there was a reason. 1st option try another dealer. 2nd option is go through the red tape to get off that list. Might take awhile though. Can’t imagine it’s easy.,legaladvice

Of course im not allowed to have it at school but I am legally allowed to have it. In our student handbook it says the second vaping offense is a 3 day suspension and a $50 fine. I was suspended but not fined. Instead the officer charged me with possession of tobacco...(a freaking misdemeanor) and he didn’t show up to the first court date. Now i have to go again and am on a $1000 bond all over a vape and I dont know if I should try to fight it or not. Are vape products legally considered tobacco products?

The thing is though, just having a contract like this doesn't guarantee you'll be repaid.  If the family member doesn't repay, your only options will be to sue in small claims court.  Having a written contract might make it easier, but doesn't make it certain.  Even if you were to get a judgement, if the person doesn't have any assets or money, collecting will be very difficult or impossible.",legaladvice

Title: **Want to give someone money, want to make sure I get it back.**

Original Post: 

> I recently came into a substantial amount of money, and, of course, there's people asking for some. I want to give one of them money and they said they'd be willing to pay me back over the next few months and willing to sign something to prove it. I'm looking for advice on how to make a legally binding document for them to sign to make sure I actually get repaid.
> If it's important, which it probably is, the person is family and I don't care about interest on this loan and would be fine getting back exactly how much I'm giving.

Title: **Landlord refuses to do repairs that directly impact my disabled child**

Original Post: 

>  My landlord is part of a national company based in the center of the country. I live in the Northeast. They regularly give me a hard time about routine maintenance work despite the fact that I’m an ideal tenant. The gate to my backyard recently fell off its hinges and they are refusing to repair it, claiming it is not a liability issue. I’ve explained that without the gate my full backyard is visible from a highly trafficked street, which makes it a security risk and a privacy issue in my mind. But more concerning is the fact that that gate is the only physical barrier between my four-year-old hearing impaired child and a very busy street.

"Yes.

But it's difficult to the point of being impractical unless the HOA is defunct. You either need the HOA to have lapsed for a very long time (multiple years, often a decade or more), or for the HOA to agree to terminate the covenants on your property, often by unanimous or supermajority vote of the members.

It is generally easier to dissolve the whole HOA than it is to remove single properties.",legaladvice

Most people will use a patent lawyer to do the search, as they have malpractice insurance to cover them (and you) should someone later come along and say that they had a patent first.  It's almost a certainty that you'll spend thousands on legal fees to get a patent approved for your idea, so it's something that you must be quite serious about (unless you have lots of money, in which case question 1 probably wouldn't be question 1).",legaladvice

"A warrant in debt simply means you are being sued by someone (or a company) for debt owed. Showing up to court gives you the opportunity to please your case as to whether or not you feel you owe the debt.

"It's time to start polishing your resume.

Then go have a conversation with your boss. Come clean about your mistake, and present your plan for fixing it. That plan will probably include sending the debt collection agency a notice that your authorization was in error and that they are not to pursue any further collection attempts, working out an agreement with the agency to settle the cost of their services to date, and probably an extensive apology to the customer you turned them loose on.

If you're very, very lucky, and if your boss is very, very understanding, and if your plan is satisfactory, you might keep your job.

The legal ramifications are that you, without authorization, bound your company to a service agreement. That agreement is very likely to be enforceable against your employer because you acted as your employer's agent. They will likely seek to recover that cost from you. They can't cut into your wages to do so, but they can take you to court over it if necessary, because you knew or should reasonably have known that you were not authorized to represent the company in this way.",legaladvice

Original Post: 

>  1st time - Paid $400 for him to tell me that it would be too expensive to fix my heat and air. Can not believe I paid him for this! I understand you took the dash apart and it was difficult but you did not fix the problem and still made me pay. I didn't know any better at the time.  
> 3rd time - Dropped it off on 3-1-19. Paid $500 up front for a $950 timing chain repair. . He wouldn't answer my calls or texts for a week after that. 2nd week rolls around he says he was sick and would start on it Monday. call him at the end of the 2nd week and says he got started late and is still working on it. I ask him if it will be through next Monday and he says he wont be working Monday because of St. Patrick's day on Sunday. I have to stop by to talk to him that week b/c by now I'm going a little crazy since he's not returning calls or texts. I go in and he says that I need a new oil drip pan and hes only going to charge me 1/2 price. 3 weeks now and I'm getting more annoyed. I go in and he tells me I'm lucky that it's taking 3 weeks or the price would be double. (I got a $900 quote after this from another mechanic and they said it should be a half days work to a week at the most). Another week goes by while he is avoiding my calls and texts. Finally on Wednesday 4-3-19 after 4 weeks he tells me I can pick it up Thursday evening. I text him that Thursday before going up there and he says the battery is dead and that he's closing up shop and I can come get it Friday. After I get off work Friday I call and he doesn't answer and then 4 minutes before the shop closes he calls and tells me I need a whole new engine. I try to get my truck back the following Monday because of course I do not want this guy to do anymore work on it and now he won't give me my truck back without paying the $550 for the timing chain and oil drip pan. Why should I pay for that? It's all pointless at this point. I need a whole new engine. I should not have to pay $1000 for this guy to tell me that my jeep needs a new engine. My truck is not fixed once again, just like the ac and heat, but I will not fall for it this time. Multiple mechanic shops have said I never should have paid for it upfront and that shows signs of being shady. They said that I DEFINITELY should not give him anymore money and that it's his fault for not getting the diagnosis right and that he should at least give me the truck back since he already made $500 off of me. Now I'm spending all my free time trying to figure out how not to pay this guy since its his fault and I need the money to buy another vehicle all while losing out on money because I'm having to borrow someone else's vehicle to do my job. Multiple mechanic shops have told me I have a case and now I'm having to deal with taking this to small claims court.

Did he actually replace the timing chain?  If you agreed to pay him $950 for a timing chain replacement and he did that job you don't have a lot of ground to stand on.  That he later determined the engine needs to be replaced doesn't invalidate the original agreement.  If he did not do the work then go pick your car up and take it to another shop.  You could consider demanding the original upfront payment (always a bad idea and definitely the sign of a shady operation) back.",legaladvice
The truck is not even drivable. He says it won't even start. I don't know what he did but if all it needed was a timing chain and he put it on there then it should start. He told me that it sat there so long with metal shavings in it that they solidified and messed it up. I brought it to him immediately when it made the noise. Is it not his fault the shavings solidified since it sat in his shop for 4 weeks?,legaladvice
"It's doubtful that time was a factor.  If there were metal shavings in the oil system the damage was probably done immediately and there was no saving the engine.  If he replaced the timing chain as you requested, you'll have a very hard time arguing that he should not be paid.",legaladvice

Title: **Wet yard**

Original Post: 

> Hello r/legal advice I hope that you can help me figure out if my parents have anything to worry about with a yard issue. At my childhood home we have a side yard that dips down into a valley, and when it rains the area gets pretty muddy and cannot really be mowed. This has been here since the house was built and we believe it is likely partially due to a natural spring as it remains relatively wet year round. We have a a neighbor who has ""sent"" (stuck a in the door) a letter with very vague pseudo threats and I am wondering what needs to be done? Does he have any actual grounds for some sort of legal action? He claims that this affects his property value but as far as I am concerned water from nature goes where it can, and if it ends up on his private property it should not be our issue. For extra context we used to have an efficient natural drainage system in the form of a ditch at the end of our property, however the same neighbor filled his end of the ditch with huge rock that stops the flow of the water causing the drainage to back up. My parents do intend on fixing the drainage problem but i want to be sure we have no legal issues that could be pressed. Thank you all for your help, I imagine this is just probably a grumpy old person with not much to do (recently retired)

> 
> 
> ""Hey guys, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit. Anyway, you know the drill, LTL, FTP, on mobile, all that fun stuff. This might be a bit long, and I won't be putting at TL;DR
> 
> As you can probably see from the title, this is about my own family. My dad (ED), my grandmother (EG), and my youngest sister (EK), who is 5. I don't really think there's any important dialogue, other than me being yelled at for trying to punish my sister when she does something wrong. Anyway, on to the main parts!
> 
> My youngest sister is 5, and was born when I was 14. I was there, and I cut her cord. I held her before mother did, gave her her first bottle, and changed her first diaper. I treat her like my own child, and she might as well be, considering I'm the only one (other than my mom) that seems to care about her. If I try to punish her for something she does wrong, or even tell her no, my dad and grandmother will get upset and full out yell at me for it. For example, our oldest cat gave birth recently, and only let's me near the babies. My sister will throw a fit if I tell her she can't hold them when I let the cat out of the carrier to check on things (we have her in a large dog carrier so she feels safe and we can keep an eye on the kittens).
> 
> She needlessly wastes food, and then throws a fit if we don't let her, and she always has the support of my wonderful father (insert eye roll) and gracious grandmother (double eye roll).
> 
> My dad is so bad, that he will cuss out my sisters (one is 13, and the other is 11), going as far as telling them to ""go fuck yourselves"" and calling them a ""stuck up bitch"". He's almost hit us several times, and doesn't seem to care. He likes pretending that he's single, and will actively bring around his ""side chicks"" and believes the world owes him something. And my grandmother doesn't stop him. Ever. And I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Is there anything that I could do to stop her from growing up to be an Entitled Kid?""
> 
> Now, my mom knows about the side chicks, and she will try to get his attention away from me and my sisters when he's mad, but it doesn't always work and sometimes just pulls her into stuff. CPS has been involved once already, but he is a really good actor and stayed by our (mine and my sisters) sides the whole time we were there. Its my grandmother's house, so we cant just put her in a home, since she pays the bills. He refuses to get a job and won't let my mom get a good job (better than working at a convince store, since she's way over qualified). Other than documenting and getting CPS involved, what can I do?

"Hypotheticals are impossible to answer. If the old supervisor told the new supervisor true facts, then there is nothing illegal about that. If the old supervisor told the new supervisor factual untrue statement that cause you to lose your job or some other financial problem, then you might have a case. 

So saying, ""HerRoyalHighnessT is a drug addict and a convicted sex offender, so you should fire them"" and then you got fired, you'd have a case. If they said, ""I terminated HerRoyalHighnessT because she called in sick when I believe she wasn't"" wouldn't be factually untrue and would be perfectly fine to say.",legaladvice
"You can be fired at any time, for any reason other than for being a member of a protected class. That means you can be fired because your supervisor didn't like you.

You can be fired because your boss doesn't like that you listen to country music in your free time. Your boss can fire you because they don't like how your lunch smells.

However, as a practical matter, the filing fees and time involved will cost you more than $67.75. I would probably pay them, get your much more valuable lower back, and leave a nasty Yelp review.",legaladvice
Yeah that's what I was thinking. I just have the extra money so I'm debating whether I want to follow that route as a matter of principle. And the lower costs less than the $82 total for me to make and now it is blemished so I would just leave it with them. But yeah nasty yelp and Google reviews are always good,legaladvice

"Very generally, it is better to turn yourself in on a bench warrant than to be arrested. Too many variables in an arrest situation, the biggest being that you don't know when or how it will happen. Also, anecdotally, it goes down better with the prosecutor if you peacefully turn yourself in. 

With regards to the bench warrant being issued, most likely it will take a day or two before the system catches up with the failure to make the fine payment, but I would not bank on it. The warrant will most likely issue soon, because he is in violation of the order. Realistically, if he can't pay, he should be prepared to serve the 9 days, and would be better off turning himself in.   


When he does that, there may be a chance to negotiate the sentence with the prosecutor, and Court. He needs to reach out though, not necessarily you. If you know where he is after a bench warrant, and are asked, you don't have to answer, but be careful in what you actually say. You don't want something stupid happening like catching an aiding and abetting or obstruction charge.

Title: **I can't get a company to refund me even though they have a guarantee**

Original Post: 

> I recently purchased a software online for the purpose of learning to read at a faster pace. The website advertises a guaranteed refund if any dissatisfaction is shown within 365 days of purchase. The cost of the software is around $80 so I decided to make the purchase knowing that I'd be promised a refund. I installed the software and noticed that none of the instructional videos even work. Also, the drills are monotonous and far from beneficial. I immediately regretted my purchase decision and when to the ""helpdesk"" to file for a refund. This is the only way to receive a refund according to the company, however I don't have the patience to wait around for a response to I called the contact number published on the website (this is also the number of contact shown on the PayPal transaction record). The man at the operator said he saw my inquiry about the refund and that he'd tell someone else to process it and to look out for an email. I since got an email from someone offering me the rest of their software suite for free in exchange for the refund, but claimed I just had to send them my phone number and they would call me if I still wanted the refund. I replied with my phone number and never received a phone call. I called the helpdesk number back and the same man as before answered, he was playing dumb and said that whoever normally processes the refund just wasn't around and that I'd have to be patient. another day passes and still no refund, this time I couldn't get in contact with the business via phones so I went to the website and a chat box popped up with the name of the guy who I talked to on the phone the previous day. I spoke with him and he went off on me claiming there was nothing he could do and that I had to be patient if I wanted a refund and that it wasn't his department who dealt with that problem. I tried asking for the contact of ANYONE else in the company and he failed to produce a single contact. At one point he even facetiously stated that I should call the police of my nearest beuro office if I fail to receive my refund within 24 hours.

I swept her shelf to the floor in anger (an uncharacteristic action I attribute to three days without sleep and one I sincerely regret), and broke several shotglasses. She later had me record a video saying I broke her shotglasses and I was sorry.

She later took back her statement, saying that she was trying to commit suicide and that I pinned her down, breaking her finger. The police said it was already referred to the DA and they have enough to arrest me and question me.
> 
> 7. She is really adamant that I tell the police she was trying to commit suicide (of which there is MUCH evidence she has been extremely suicidal recently, including attempts) and that I pinned her down. If I tell the truth, she says I’ll get convicted because it wasn’t self defense because I could have “taken 2 steps back” and she ways 109lbs. She went to law school, I didn’t. I feel like I need to trust her.
> 
> I don’t want to get convicted, I sincerely didn’t intend to hurt her when I pushed her to the ground. I don’t want to get in trouble with my fiancé, but she’s the kind of person who checks the police report to see the story I told them. What do I do? Do they have some sort of advocate I should talk to? Leaving my fiancé is out of the question.

But it's certainly possible that company A can take legal action against you and inform your new employer of that legal action, which would just be a headache all in of itself.

"This is good news. Generally speaking, they should give you a reasonable amount of time to have the non-compete reviewed by a professional.

Title: **Town requiring decals to park in our own driveways**

Original Post: 

>  Is it legal for an incorporated town to require decals on vehicles that park in the driveways of private residence? The county we live in requires no decals and the state requires a safety inspection and license plate stickers. The town police advised they will come onto private driveways and ticket vehicles without a town decal... No benefit comes from the purchase of the decal and just another hit to the wallet. Am I able to seek legal action against the town for a town officer to come on my property to ticket a valid vehicle with the county and state? Thank you for any input!!

"> We’ve been advised that because a) he’s done his own electrical work and is probably not fully permitted overall on the property we could break our lease and b) we probably even have a case for harassment

Advised by whom?",legaladvice
We called a pay by the minute lawyer who said A when advising us not to sign his letter. B comes from a friend who is not a lawyer.,legaladvice
"One individual is allowed to gift another individual up to $15,000 per year before taxes would kick in.  Since you said ""parents"" (plural), this means that they are able to EACH gift him $15k, so $30k total.  Since you two were/are married, that increases to each of them being able to also gift you $30k per year, so $60k total from one married couple to another, which happens to exactly equal the $5,000 a month they're paying him.  So it's possible they're well aware of this, and if they only increased to that amount once you two were married, that seems very likely.  

As for divorce and/or alimony, you need a lawyer.  It's my understanding that alimony is highly unlikely in a short marriage, as even if you did make sacrifices for the benefit of the family unit, they're short lived and easily reversed.  Alimony is meant more for someone who stays home to watch kids, sacrifices their career opportunities to move around the country (or world) with a military spouse, etc.  If you're able to continue working along the same career path you have been prior to the marriage, you aren't likely eligible for any alimony.  When it's used to even out very different incomes, that's much more of a long-term marriage thing, because both spouses were living at the same lifestyle level, even if one earned more and the other earned less.  But if you've been married 2.5 MONTHS, that's not going to be a factor.  But talk to a lawyer about what you can expect.  And definitely don't sign any sort of post-nup.",legaladvice
"So alimony in Oklahoma basically is looked at one of two ways (talking about support alimony here, vs alimony in lieu of property, since that's what you seem to be asking about). Which way it's viewed largely depends on the age of the person and length of the marriage.

&#x200B;

There's rehabilitative, which is based on getting the partner who gave up educational opportunities or what have you to stay in the home, raise kids, etc, or maybe go to work so the other could get an education. This is with younger people, who have shorter marriages and/or can reasonably expected to become a part of the workforce and economically self-sufficient.  


Then there's the maintenance model. With older people, where the's very little chance realistically of rehabbing them and a long marriage with a lifestyle they've become accustomed to which has in part been attained through their efforts as homemaker etc (in other words some form of martial labor), this is designed to keep them in something closer to that lifestyle they're accustomed to.  


Both require there be a demonstrated need, that's rationally related to the marriage itself, and ability to pay. So you'd have to show that you gave up your job and education to keep the home etc, and that you can't just go back to your job for whatever reason.  


Also, your point about common law...I highly doubt he's going to agree that a common law marriage exists, especially once he/his counsel realize it would make your arguments for alimony easier. So that would be an issue for trial. And it's harder to prove than you think. Even though it seems simple, with the list of conditions. Take, for example, holding oneself out as husband and wife. Seems pretty cut and dried. But I know of an Oklahoma opinion that involved a couple were the man sometimes introduced her as his wife professionally. Seems to fit the bill, but the holding? No common law marriage. So you shouldn't bank on that.",legaladvice
"You’ve been married less than 3 MONTHS, and you expect alimony?  Did you mean years?",legaladvice
You are entitled to a one month written notice to vacate.  Without that they cannot evict you from the apartment.,legaladvice
"If that is your residence, she (or whoever let you live there) can give you 30 days notice to vacate under N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 232-a. If you are not out in 30 days she can start a formal eviction process in court.

If anyone changes the locks or does anything to your belongings, that is illegal, and you can report it to the police.",legaladvice
"Since you've been there 30 months, you're effectively her tenant that she has sublet to. You get 30 days notice, and if she throws your shit out or bars you from the property, it's an illegal eviction (for which you can sue). Illegal evictions, in NY, are costly.

However, and this is important, it's possible cops won't force her to let you back in (they often will consider it a civil matter), which means you need to have somewhere to stay as a backup if she decided to kick you out.",legaladvice
She wants you out and for 3 months... Dude leave. Yes the laws on your side but kinds makes it seems it shouldn't be.,legaladvice

Original Post: 

> My parents own the condo i live in.
> 
> A few years ago the condo upstairs had been for sale, and while unoccupied their bathtub was leaking into our condo and caused a lot of damage. The HOA sent someone to cut a giant hole in our ceiling to dry it out. They had to get a locksmith upstairs to break in just to turn the water off. The plumber said hed be back, he never came back. I called him, he said hes not coming back until he gets paid for the work he did already. We didnt call him, the hoa did. The water damage was not our fault. It was the HOAs responsibility to contact the homeowner about the damages but in the week this happened, they managed to sell the condo without paying for the damages.

> So the new owner wasnt going to pay... we had a hole in our ceiling for nearly two years! Of course we could have fixed it, but my parents were being stubborn because of the principle of things...
> 
> Because of this we refused to pay the HOA fees. 
> 
> In the meantime, the HOA had changed management companies. 
> 
> After about 2 years, my parents came out to visit. My dad fixed the hole himself.  My mom and the hoa had come to some sort of agreement and my mom started paying the HOA fees again.

> Now, somehow, the HOA changed management companies for a third time and my mom was still sending checks to former HOA. The checks werent being cashed apparently (i was just told about this). 
> 
> No one contacted anybody about anything (the hoa wasnt contacting my mom to send the checks to the new company, my mom wasn't contacting anybody about the checks being uncashed...)

> Fast forward to today, and i get a knock on the door from some dude whose company bought our 'foreclosed' condo today and we have a week to move out. Um, what?!? Foreclosed? My parents dont even have a mortgage on this condo, i believe. I called my mom and dad in a panic. Shes at work, i have no idea what is going on. Im freaking out.
> 
> Nothing was posted on our door, nothing was sent certified mail. Just some dude with a business card that says he owns our condo now.

> TLDR: after not paying HOA fees because we had unpaid damage that was not ours, came to an agreement, began paying fees again. HOA management company changed and checks were being still sent to old company. New management company foreclosed our fully paid for condo because of ""unpaid HOA fees""

"You’re parents need a lawyer to straighten this out and proof of all payments made throughout the entire time. In cases like these, you need a lawyer and pronto. Good luck...",legaladvice
"Standard Disclaimer: I am a Colorado lawyer, but not your lawyer. Nothing herein constitutes specific legal advice, nor does it establish an attorney-client relationship. You are advised to contact a lawyer IRL, as this is a general discussion of the law. 

In Colorado, under the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act (CCIOA, typically pronounced like Kiowa), an HOA can place a lien on the property, and foreclose, for a failure to pay HOA fees. The HOA lien attaches automatically, and without required Notice. It would show up on a title search, but the owner is not required to be served. The other thing to know is that it does not matter if there is a mortgage on the property, or not. This is an independent right of action, granted by statute. That part is not especially controversial. 

These liens can be foreclosed, but unlike a mortgage foreclosure in Colorado, the foreclosure of an HOA lien requires the filing of a lawsuit (what is known as a judicial foreclosure). That would require service of process on the owners, and interest holders in the property. If the owners are international, it is possible to get service by publication, upon the filing of an affidavit, and the placing of an add in ""publications of common circulation."" It is entirely possible that this is what happened in this case.

As a first step, a title company can, for $5-10 bucks, provide something called an Ownership and Encumbrances report regarding the property (an ""O&E""). That will show, typically, the liens and ownership of a property. It would be worth checking to see if a lien was actually filed. Before that though, the County Clerk or Assessor's office often has an online search tool to check property history. A little Google-fu is a good place to start. Googling the property address is often worthwhile as well, because it could pull up any published service of process. 

This is a real, and immediate issue. It is time for a lawyer, and quickly. Your parents may still have what is known as a ""right of redemption,"" or an opportunity to cure. However, if the sale has happened (and I am skeptical about that if you did not receive anything in the mail, and the guy who showed up did not produce any paperwork), you need to act very quickly. 

Also, in the future, and to anyone listening out there, DO NOT STOP PAYING YOUR HOA FEES BECAUSE YOU ARE MAD AT THEM! It never ends well. 

Best of luck, and call a lawyer ASAP.",legaladvice
"Delete this post, delete all the files and speak with no one. If the police come looking for you, all you have to say it, ""I want a lawyer"". Keep repeating those words.

2. Then he would really send more people at me because of how ""snitching"" is seen among people in that lifestyle, also they those people wouldn't care for the full story or see it with a sense of maturity just that i am a ""snitch"" and need to be dealt with

When we started music we were kinda just winging it cause we were young and inexperienced I guess. Although I have mentioned to him multiple times that there needs to be some sort of recognition that I made the instrumental he just rapped on it off of studio time that I paid for. Also I had to log into our sound cloud and put my producer credits on the song because he didn't. I do feel like I have some ownership over the song naturally especially cause he never paid for them.,legaladvice
Also he has other songs that I didn't touch because I didnt make them. He thinks I did this to bring him down when that is not the case If I wanted to bring him down I would've deleted everything he has. There isn't really any type of agreement in writing cause like I said we were inexperienced. Also I think alot of his anger stems from the fact that the songs he did with me were his most popular by far and now they are gone.,legaladvice
"Thank you, I know I should I am just somewhat nervous/scared mainly for the safety of my family especially my little siblings never had something like this happen. I didn't expect him to explode with anger and wished he was just mature about it and moved on. I am highly considering installing some cameras on my house as some precaution.",legaladvice

Title: **I can no longer afford my car payments.**

Original Post: 

> Hey guys, 
> 
> Please let me know I should be posting this elsewhere!
> 
> Long story short, a year ago next month I got a car. The car (2014 Ford Focus) was advertised as being $8,000, but I walked out of the dealership over $17,000 more in debt than before. No clue how that happened. Dude at the dealership assured me that it had to do with the warranty and how it “covers everything”, but when I needed my breaks worked on recently, I had to pay for the job entirely out of pocket. This was one of the worst final mistakes of my life.
> 
> My grandma was with me at the dealership, encouraging me to buy the car, and insisted on paying my car payments for 3 years (I was pregnant at the time, and she said she wanted to pay for the car for the first few years as an elaborate gift for becoming a new parent). Regrettably, I agreed. After a recent disagreement, however, she has informed me that she will no longer be paying my car payments. Currently SO &amp; I are scrambling to find a way to increase our income to make ends meet with this new expense.  
> 
> So my question is... is there any way to get out of this? What would my best course of action be? I’ve heard that what’s going to have to happen is, I’ll have to turn in the car to the credit union my loan is with, they will sell it, and I will be responsible to pay back the balance left (say I have $15,000 left to pay; they sell it for $6,000, I have to pay back $9,000). If that’s the case, yikes.

> What I want and need is an older SUV, something affordable. I don’t care about, need, or want all the bells and whistles.

"There's no way warranties could cost $9000 on an $8000 vehicle.  $17000 was likely too high a price for the vehicle at the time. You misunderstood something or were sold something you didn't need.  Without seeing the paperwork it's impossible to say.  That said, warranties almost never cover brakes or other ware items, like tires and windshield wipers.  If you signed the paperwork there's probably not much you can do at this point, even if the dealership did something shady.  You need to practice due diligence when buying used vehicles.  The financed used car market is a total snake pit.

&#x200B;

Your only option at this point is as you described, too turn in the vehicle.  It's probably worth in the $6-9k range now and you'll have to pay the difference on what you owe.  Call the company that provided the loan and ask what your options are.  It's possible that you could be put on some kind of payment plan.",legaladvice

Long story short there, I was told that I could come back in 30 days for (opinion time, acknowledged) doing something that the moderators also did. 30 days are up, and I try to rejoin, and I'm told I'm not allowed.

Then realized I had no idea what concrete material she submitted and asked for it. I was denied, under ""confidentiality."" I told them it was really suspicious, and I should know what I was specifically defending myself from. I was denied, and repeatedly told it was confidential, but I was allowed to defend myself. 
> 
> I went on a bit, not really intending on really rejoining if things went well, but to grab screenshots. I made these screenshots public and called on the group to acknowledge and fix the conduct,  or I'd keep things up and people would know they condone of that type of moderation.
> 
> Long story short, a handful of other people came out and said ""yeah they're like that, thanks for saying something.""
> 
> The head of group B has tried to threaten me under ""libel"" of her ""intellectual property"" (she considers her group a part of her, and things said against it upset her). I asked her if there was more information she could send me that could prove me wrong, and she declined, stating ""I'll present it in court.""
> 
> I offered to reword some of my harsh language to specify I meant the moderator conduct -in- the group, and that I didn't want it to be condoned by the group. I did so. She said that wasn't good enough, and that's not a ""real"" apology so long as I use any negative language whatsoever, and ""I'll see you in court.""
> 
> I'm grabbing my evidence in hard copies, because I'm not really worried about proving that I didn't make false claims, to the best of my knowledge (and that she's not interested in objectively correcting me).

I think Richard Ojeda (he lost his 2018 House race by 13 points in a district that voted for Trump by **50 points**) is your guy. He has the kind of populist sensibility that can be movement-building and carry on to future elections.

I made this account in dishonor of Susan Collins specifically, after she voted for Kavanaugh and made a big spectacle of a speech (how's his respect for precedence concerning Roe going, by the way? Not so good, huh?). **THERE ARE NO MODERATE REPUBLICANS**. It is a party of extremists. They are pushing bills to execute women for having abortions *right now*. They are the party of Christian Sharia Law. They the party of double-standards. They will poison the earth until it is ravaged beyond hope. They will buddy-up with fascists all over the globe and then decry ""globalists"" in the same breath. They will push for for the strongest enforcement of the law for migrants, poor people, and people of color. And then they will treat their own as being above the law.

Being a Republican in 2019 is unacceptable. Endorsing one is unacceptable. Susan Collins is no moderate. Joe Manchin is no moderate. They both need to go.",politics

Of course she'll most likely hop from the Senate into a sinecure provided by one of her many corporate BFFs.  There's always a low-effort/high salary gig waiting for scum like her.

">The road back to a liberal majority on the court will be tenuous, not to mention long: In 2020, Democrats would need to oust a Walker-appointed justice, and in 2023, they would also need to defeat the current conservative Chief Justice Patience Roggensack, who has served on the Court since 2003. Both candidates will likely have the might of the state’s Republican Party behind them, and have the advantage of being incumbents.

* When the old US-backed dictator, Mubarak, was threatened to be overthrown by popular peaceful protests, Hillary Clinton as Sec. of State bleated out statements about the need for ""stability"" in Egypt.

* Only when the handwriting was clearly written on the wall that the US-backed Egyptian dictator would be overthrown was Obama rolled out to make mild-mannered statements about ""democracy"" and ""non-violence.""

* After Mubarak was overthrown Egypt established a democratic gov't and the Egyptian people elected a Muslim-oriented gov't because that's what the Egyptian people wanted.

* The US-backed/trained/funded Egyptian military then overthrew the democratic Egyptian gov't. Obama never even bothered to cut off US military aid to the Egyptian military as required by US law.

* To stomp down the democratic desires of the Egyptian people for their elected gov't, the US-backed/trained/funded Egyptian military then instituted a reign of terror and killed about 1000 supporters of the democratic Egyptian gov't -- and the US remained silent during this slaughter.

* A US-trained Egyptian general then took off his uniform, put on a suit, ran a rigged, sham election, and then became the new Egyptian president.

* And as this article points out, that former US-trained Egyptian general is now ""president for life"" -- in other words, the *new dictator.*

Isn't that a factual summary of what happened?

It turns out one of his alt-right supporter initially followed Yang for the money but eventually Yang's campaign message turned his anger into hope.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I use to think we were suppose to condemn these people. But after talking to this guy, it got me thinking that alienating them would just cause their anger to fester even more and therefore they will be a more hateful person. Instead, maybe the more effective solution in fighting extremism is using empathy which is a core tenant of Yang's message.

Anyways, after talking to this former alt-right person, I started looking into how to fight hate in our country.

&#x200B;

You think him attracting former trump-supporters is a negative thing, but I see it as a positive. Literally no other candidate is uniting left, right and progressives like Yang. It's one of the major reasons I support him and I'm about as opposite from the Alt-Right as possible (check my anti-trump user history). I strongly feel that the political pendulum is getting way too extreme: Clinton begat GWB who begat Obama who begat trump. If we elect the an extreme leftist, we'll piss off the right even more in 2024 and we'll get someone worse than trump. The right likes him because he is problem-solving instead of playing identity politics. Don't get me wrong, Andrew thinks the president is terrible, but his pitch to the MAGAs is, ""Hey, you were looking to trump to fix your economic problems and he lied to you. I can help you fix the problems he failed to."" If you care about your mental heath regarding all the shit trump does, come to r/YangForPresidentHQ.

I find that refreshing as well. But to say that Bernie hasn't ""taken responsibility"" for it is disingenuous.

He treats people on the right like humans not enemies. And even though all his social politics are as liberal as they get; they are still willing to support him. I've never seen a candidate so proficient at pitching complicated problems in a way for everyone to understand. Every interviewer starts their talk with an air of suspicion, but by the end you can tell they respect Yang.

I agree the alt right is the alt right and thats a problem. And look I don't like the alt right, not one bit. But think about it why are these people so racist / bigoted. Were they born bigots? Certainly not but something must have happened in their lives that led them to this path.

&#x200B;

With that said, I did talk to one of Yang's alt-right supporter. Turns out he left the alt-right because he felt that Yang's message of unity gave him hope and this guy can't even stand the alt-right and their bigoted views. But if we dig a little deeper on what happened to this person you find out that he wasn't a bad person. But apparently when your neighbors in the midwest are unemployed, loosing their jobs and dying of a opoid crisis you become overwhelmed with despair and get angry with the world. 

&#x200B;

Does that excuse the alt-right for the bigoted views? Of course not. But how do we de-radicalize hate? We can condemn these people, which sweeps the problem under the rug and their hate will still fester. Or we can try to reach out to them with empathy and disarm their hate. According to experts, it turns out empathy is the best weapon at fighting extremism in our country and it seem to work with Yang and one of his supporter. I think we should all give it a try since it is so easy for us to insult and deride one another online. =)

Even if this was true, so what do we do?  Should people be unable to criticize her words?  

Nobody forced her to use this language about 9/11 (or even bring up 9/11 at all).  Nobody forced her to use potential dog whistles about Jewish people.  Nobody forced her to criticize lobbying while receiving PAC money.

So, when people are attacking her over this phrase and alleging she is unAmerican, etc. and using this as proof, it is certainly not a legitimate or semi-legitimate critique.

The difference or the thing you are leaving out is that right wing aligned media and organizations are stoking those threats and actual violence.

Whether its Trump himself calling for violence, the NRA putting out ads that call for violence against the left, or Rupert Murdoch owned entities that are calling for violence against the left, these things are all stoking the first till crazy people actually make the move.

Sometimes its super obvious, sometimes its slight or dog whistles, but its happening and the rise of right wing terrorism shows that it is having an effect and people are actually dying because of it. Proof in point, the New Zealand shooter said he was inspired by Candace Owens, the same Candace Owens who recently tried to say that Hitler wasn't that bad.  the New Zealand shooter also cited Trump as well.

If those were primarily only the view of my generation who was dying out and there were no feasible ways to achieve any of it through purely democratic means, would I be okay with subverting democracy in order to achieve those goals in society around me?


The answer I think is no but I'm not in that situation and I believe it would be a lot more gray if I were.

Meanwhile, the state's infrastructure [continues to disintegrate](https://csengineermag.com/northeast-ohio-infrastructure-receives-d-grade-from-civil-engineers/), largely because it's not an issue that brings their people to the polling booth:

>The report card finds  that much of the region’s infrastructure is in poor to fair condition  and is mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of  their service life. Energy and schools both earned the lowest grades in  the Report Card, each taking home a “D.” One third of energy consumed in the region is generated outside the region, and the region’s aging distribution networks built in times of population expansion prior the 1960s require continuous care and improvement.  
>  
>Estimates by the Cleveland Section of ASCE suggest that about half of the schools in the region have not undergone significant renovations over the past 40 years, and only about 60 percent of school districts have buildings that fully meet current state and/or federal standards. The Ohio Facilities Construction Commission funding spiked in 2008 from a tobacco settlement, which resulted in four years of over $800 million available per year to K-12 schools. However, over the past five years, construction disbursements have dropped to an average of approximately $275 million per year. The report also finds the resiliency of school buildings concerning. 91 percent of school buildings are designated to serve as emergency shelters, but most do not have backup power systems and are not constructed to withstand natural disasters common to Ohio.  
>  
>Notably, the report finds that road safety is of concern and requires attention. NEO roads (“D+”) are seeing an uptick in traffic accidents.  In 2017, there were 49,973 traffic accidents in the five-county region, including 166 fatalities. Additionally, the region faces a funding shortfall issue, particularly to address its future needs. Infrastructure challenges continue to limit the number of bridges which can be repaired or replaced as well as road maintenance.

I wish people would do this to Beto.,politics
"Schultz's big idea was really not about coffee, but about the rapid expansion of the ""coffee shop"" idea which was quickly becoming really popular in Seattle.  He bought the Starbucks name and the original location.

It's actually a very similar story to Ray Kroc's expansion of McDonald's.  He liked their burgers and thought that their efficient operation would scale well.  He certainly had some good ideas along the way, but both really had the same idea.  Let's take this already successful concept and make it attractive to the average American.

"Minor nitpick, but Starbucks is now a milk company that also sells some coffee, sometimes.

Actually, your analysis is dead on balls accurate.  Starbucks sells sweetened, flavored milk that contains coffee.  Some of their drinks are nothing more than liquid candy bars.

Third-party candidates are a perennial presence and in this election Stein was largely outweighed by Johnson (not sure about within the particular swing states). Also, Russian interference, and other Republican voting fuckery. I don't think it's right to say Stein was ""the reason"" Clinton didn't win. (*An important reason*, sure.)

"Bernie has every possible advantage this time around — all of the advantages he lamented Hillary had last time that he lacked. 

If he can’t win in this environment, then you’re just going to have to put your big girl panties on and vote for the nominee. 

The voters will decide, again, as they did last time. 

Voters who choose to stay home on Election Day because they’re not “inspired” will be blamed — and deservedly so. **There is absolutely no excuse to not make it your absolute highest priority to vote for whoever the nominee is on Election Day 2020. NONE.**

The Supreme Court balance right now is 5-4, with conservatives having the majority. **RBG is 86** years old. She’s not going to be able to make it another 4 years. **Breyer** (another liberal justice) **is 80** and he’s *been ready* to retire. He’ll probably retire soon after 2020 no matter who wins — he’s not quite the machine that Ruth is such that he’ll even want to try to stay on until his late 80’s. 

**If Dems don’t win the presidency in 2020, we’ll be looking at a 7-2 majority conservative SCOTUS for a generation.** 

This isn’t speculation. This is real life. The Court will outlaw abortion and we’ll have thousands of women and girls [meet the same fate as Gerri Santoro](http://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m99x7cu3ay1rdklleo1_500.jpg). Burdens for women, minorities, and all the other non corporate “little guys” — to seek any kind of recourse in the courts will be raised across the board. *Believe me.* It’ll be the Lochner era — back when the court held child labor was totes cool and struck down any and every type of worker protection — on steroids. 

And I didn’t even touch upon how critical 2020 is for redistricting — in short, 2020 could effectively determine which party controls the majority for a whole decade.

There's literally no reason to think that other than your desire to justify your own moderate views. The white ruling class in the south had brutalized and exploited african americans the entire time they were in power *prior* to the radical reconstruction, and they *went back* to brutalizing and exploiting them as soon as they had power again. To blame radical reconstruction for *the continuation* of the behavior that the white southern ruling class was engaged in prior to radical reconstruction happening makes no sense at all. It is just something you are choosing to think because it confirms your own ideology.

""[The Council on American-Islamic Relations] was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”


The focus of her speech was not 9/11, so there was no reason for her to go into any detail about it.",politics
"Context matters, your comment is either misinformed or in bad faith.",politics
"9/11 was a heinous and despicable act, there is no doubt.  But politicians for years downplayed and trampled over civil rights by pointing to 9/11 and screaming about the need for more and more security.  It has been used as justification for one of the biggest clawback in civil rights in modern times.

In that context, she's asking why everybody is still paying the price for something done by a handful of individuals.  It's a fair and objective question when you remove the emotional impact of that tragedy from the context and it's one that should be discussed objectively and not emotionally.  In fairness, she could probably have worded a bit better.

If people want to be outraged over politicians downplaying 9/11 then it should be over the fact that the government gave the terrorists exactly what they wanted to accomplish, the erosion of freedom and the spread of fear, rather than standing up for the very principles that were attacked that day.",politics

It seems to me the only context missing from Owens quotes is that she doesn't think nationalism means what everyone else thinks it means. It's doublespeak. So she can use the word nationalism in a positive light and then denounce anyone who calls her on it because she decided to use an exotic definition. It's like she planted the bait and Lieu took it. To get at the original context for Owen you need to listen to or read 2 hours of content. This looks almost calculated on the (R) end of things.

Omar's line was taken completely out of context.  The ""people that did something"" she was referring to were the people who established CAIR in the aftermath of 9/11 which is completely clear when you include the rest of the quoted sentence and the preceding sentence.",politics

"Whoa whoa whoa......are you actually saying that “nationalism” by definition is “nazism”? Like nationalism is murdering and torturing your own citizens? 

Now I understand your confusion, let me help you.

Nationalism: Noun. Identification with one’s own nation and support for its interests, especially to the exclusion of detriment of the interest’s of other nations.

Patriotism: Noun. The quality of being patriotic; devotion to and vigorous support for one’s country, (Included just in case your bias made you forget that patriotism and nationalism are one in the same)

You see, what she said is, people like conflating Nazism with nationalism but in fact hitler was not a nationalist. She was drawing a dividing line between nationalism and hitler. Nationalism being an overly weighted concern for your own people/country over others and the other being a murdering psychopath bent on world domination - who is in no way the face of nationalism as murdering your own citizens specifically goes against the very definition of nationalism.

I’m not saying that “nationalism” in its pure non murderous unadulterated form is a good or bag thing. I’m simply saying there is no way anyone with basic comprehension skills can come to the conclusion that Candace Owens supports Hitler. 

But alas, believe what you will.",politics
"Ah!  So you're shitposting in bad faith.  I told you what the dog whistle was and you used the idiotically limited dictionary definition to pretend otherwise.  [Here's the more expansive definition from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism).

[Here's the definition for the people she was speaking to](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/white-nationalist).

> Adherents of white nationalist groups believe that white identity should be the organizing principle of the countries that make up Western civilization. White nationalists advocate for policies to reverse changing demographics and the loss of an absolute, white majority. Ending non-white immigration, both legal and illegal, is an urgent priority — frequently elevated over other racist projects, such as ending multiculturalism and miscegenation — for white nationalists seeking to preserve white, racial hegemony.

You're going to need to bring a lot of evidence to demonstrate that [CPAC is anything other than a hotbed of white nationalism](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cpac-white-nationalists_n_5a971c92e4b09c872bb0e770) with a few tokens like Owens, Diamond and Silk, and Dinesh D'Felon just like the Nazis had Ernst Rohm.

Bad faith is so boring.

> Never believe that anti‐ Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti‐Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced. They fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side.",politics

Again, you make clear the issue is she believes the issue is he wanted to take his views outside of the nation.

Nationalism is not just about what is best for your nation but also the selective identification of who qualifies as a member of your nation.

Globalism is the identification of the interconnectedness of the world.

Hitler was a nationalist, wanting to expand his nation to the entire world, wanting only the members of his nation who he thought were worthy.

You want to nitpick a definition to its most fine detail and then misrepresent the other terms in order to justify what is a disgusting statement by her.

No believing what we will, recognizing words for what they are.  She attempts to misrepresent nationalism to distance those views from Hitler when they are exactly what drove Hitler and her misrepresentation is at best ignorant of reality.

"Hitler Didn’t kill his own people, He killed the people that weren’t pure enough in his eyes. He wanted to create a nation that was ruled by the people he considered pure. 

Yes he was a nationalist, but he was a nationalist that was driven by thoughts of racial purity and of Empire.

It’s called ethnic nationalism And it is the reason why a country like Japan treated people from Korea so horrendously during World War II, Even though Korea it was part of Japan at the beginning of the war.

I think that the beginning of her statement that was coded at the hearing is easily misinterpreted and no I don’t think she was actually supporting Hitler, but her entire premise was an attempt to separate the actions of Hitler from the concept of nationalism.",politics

“[W]hile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him"" indicates that Congress needs to see all of the underlying information about this question as well.

To suggest that the Democratic committee chairs are just furthering a ""politically motivated witch hunt"" and should consider themselves lucky to get a redacted version of the report is **absolutely asinine**. 

If you read the letter they sent to Barr, it sure seems there is good precedent for them to get the entire report. Why should we be afraid of them getting it? And why is it that Trump and his supporters want to hide so much? This has become a troubling pattern.

So maybe just consider that these Democratic chairs have good intentions. If you can think that Donald Trump has good intentions (I'm just assuming here), you can surely think the same of Democratic congressmen.",politics

But filings by the department since June 2017 reveal a new interpretation that “… would permit the president – and all federal officials – to accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments, **as long as the money comes through commercial transactions with an entity owned by the federal official**,” the professor writes.

The DOJ's new position is very similar to what Trump's private lawyers advocated for around the time of the inauguration.

>On 11 January 2017, just days before he was sworn in, Dillon said Trump isn’t accepting any payments in his “official capacity” as president, **as the income is only related to his private business**. “Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present, and it has nothing to do with an office,” Dillon said.

Previously, the DOJ would [look at three factors](http://kathleenclark.law/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-02-07-Clark-The-Lawyers-Who-Mistook-A-President-for-their-Client-w-Appendices.pdf#page=13) to determine if a benefit that came from an organization tied to a foreign government would be considered an emolument.

> (1) whether the foreign government directed the benefit to the federal employee; (2) whether the foreign government controls the intermediary (such as by selecting its board members); and (3) whether the foreign government provides substantial funding for the intermediary.",politics

Domestic emoluments clause:

"> Dillon said Trump isn’t accepting any payments in his “official capacity” as president, as the income is only related to his private business. “Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present, and it has nothing to do with an office,” Dillon said.

This is hilarious. One of the most popular ways to launder money is “through a private business”. 

You can sell drugs and let people use credit cards through your private business. Have a house cleaning business and when you deliver drugs simply take a napkin and wipe off the counter and charge $100 on the customers credit card. 

Similarly, Trump at his hotels could sell $1000 shots of “luxury” wine out of a $40 bottle and say that he’s selling an “experience”. And foreign entities can buy rounds for everybody and funnel $75,000 to Trump in a single night with no way to “prove” it was improper.

It's customary for presidents to divest themselves from business while in office, yet presidents have a tradition of writing books and so it wasn't really controversial for him to continue to receive royalties for books written before he was president.

At least one children's book he authored while in office had its [proceeds go entirely to charity](https://www.masslive.com/politics/2012/05/president_obama_earned_between.html).

However somebody picking up a copy of *Audacity of Hope* which may result in Obama receiving a few pennies is a far cry from a president in office actively managing hotels, resorts and real estate and earning large sums.

Hopefully everyone will read this. The context isnt even close.,politics
"Unfortunately I am required to post the headline in full word for word. 

I wonder if Comey agrees with Barr’s conclusions on no collusion?

Barr’s summary below: 

“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,”

“...Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Council’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an “obstruction-of-justice offense.”",politics

"Yeah, I understand the headline needs to be a copy/paste. 

Barr's summary isn't worth the paper it's written on.  Trump's could have personally directed and coordinated with a team of russian oligarchs connected to the Kremlin, but because he didn't interact directly with anyone in the Russian government, this statement would still be true: 

""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,”

Unfortunately that distinction requires nuance, and in today's political climate that doesn't exist.  We need the full report.",politics

Inslee for EPA,politics
"It's not a perfect place, but I love it.
From the Wikipedia:

Washington is one of the wealthiest and most liberally progressive states in the country. The state consistently ranks among the best for life expectancy and low unemployment.[3] Along with Colorado, Washington was one of the first to legalize medicinal and recreational cannabis, was among the first thirty-six states to legalize same-sex marriage, doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal abortions on request before the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade loosened federal abortion laws. Similarly, Washington voters approved a 2008 referendum on legalization of physician-assisted suicide, and is currently only one of five states, along with Oregon, California, Colorado and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia to have legalized the practice. The state is also one of eight in the country to have criminalized the sale, possession and transfer of bump stocks, with California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Maryland, and Massachusetts also having banned these devices.",politics

"The data appears to be pretty clear here. This is a big problem. Why possible justification could there be to Target the poor more then the wealthy? And as if that wasn’t enough they are clearly targeting non-whites. Yes, this is accurately described by the author as racist. But I want to know, what is the IRS trying to do here? Do poor non-whites put up less of a fight in an audit?",politics
"Related ProPublica story, [""**Lawmakers Just Confronted the IRS Over Tax Audits That Target the Poor** - Following up on ProPublica stories about the IRS, lawmakers pressed the commissioner on the agency’s disproportionate focus on auditing the working poor while examinations of the rich plummeted.](https://www.propublica.org/article/lawmakers-to-irs-commissioner-charles-rettig-system-stacked-for-the-rich)

"The author hand-waves off the EITC explanation (it’s a well-known fact that EITC recipients face higher audit rates that other relatively low-income folks), which seems like a more rational explanation than “a government body is systematically targeting blacks for audits.”",politics
"What is your definition of “hand-waves”? The author speaks to this and dedicates several paragraphs speaking to the EITC. From the article-

“According to the Brookings Institute, white-working voters make up the largest percentage of EITC tax filers (nearly 50 percent) while black filers only make up 19 percent of earned income-filers. Yet, the heaviest concentration of IRS scrutiny is exclusively in places where black people live.”",politics
"> “According to the Brookings Institute, white-working voters make up the largest percentage of EITC tax filers (nearly 50 percent) while black filers only make up 19 percent of earned income-filers. Yet, the heaviest concentration of IRS scrutiny is exclusively in places where black people live.”

Right, and then he goes on to cite the top ten most/least audited counties in the US to draw a link between audit rate and race (as, conveniently, the most audited counties are pretty black and the least audited are pretty white). But assuming the link between claiming the EITC and audit rate, the real question is **is there a disproportionate amount of EITC filers in the ""most audited counties in America,"" which is largely a question of income**, not race. 

The TPC, in fact, [recently published](https://tpc-eitc-tool.urban.org/) a pretty good tool for exploring their data set. You can input a county, and it'll tell you how many tax returns claimed the EITC. On the ""most audited counties"" list, Humphreys, MS had 1,785 EITC returns (population 8,342). Tunica, MS had 2,465 EITC returns (population 10,024). On the other side of things, Mercer County, OH had 2,400 EITC returns (population 40,873). North Slope, AK had 303 EITC returns (population 9,782). I didn't go through the other counties, but it seems like my guess is likely the correct explanation here -- the high audit rates are largely explained by disparities in number of EITC returns, not race.",politics

Exactly. But they don't give each other shit for being millionaires.,politics
"No one cares. It's some weird bank-shot shit from the right masquerading as ""some liberals say"" bullshit. 

Some on the left were unhappy that Sanders was foot dragging on releasing his taxes. They were unhappy because Trump has *really* made that shit toxic, they were unhappy because it *looks* sketchy, and they were unhappy that -- as pretty hefty front-runner *and* the runner-up last election, Sanders should have had that ready to go day 1. Lead by example, make a difference, stand apart, do the right thing -- shit like that.

Of course, those reasons are too simple, uncomplicated, and easy to understand. People don't get all dramatic about that. Even the most pro-Sanders supporter would say ""Yes, that's a reasonable statement. I mean I don't feel strongly about it, but I can understand why you might expect Sanders to be a lot more proactive than, say, Random Democratic Candidate 17. Asking him to release his tax returns is not, in any way, a ridiculous request. Until Trump, it was an unspoken requirement for a serious candidate!"".

But as that is not *dramatic*, and because the left is all a bunch of communists and die-hard socialists, and since Sanders is clearly their standard bearer, the *real reason* people wanted his taxes released (and supposedly why he was hiding them) was because he was *rich*, and the proletariat would revolt and the communist uprising come down! SUCH DRAMA. 

In short, this ""Sanders is a millionare! HA-HA!"" shit is what morons on the right think *matters* to the left. They think liberals *hate wealth* and *hate success*. 

 People wanted Sanders to publish his returns right away to show he -- Democratic frontrunner and major party figure -- was *different* than Trump. To make one of what will be a million things he (along with everyone else in the field) are going to be doing to say ""I'm not a senile corrupt hobgoblin like Trump"".

LOL does anyone on either side give a rat's ass what Rick Wilson thinks?,politics
They’re both Russian trolls?,politics
They both blame nefarious conspiracies any time their hero doesn't get his way.,politics
">Make no mistake: Julian Assange was a willing asset of Russia in the 2016 election. He was a vital conduit in their information warfare campaign. The US intelligence community has long known this; even Trump’s current Secretary of State and former Director of Central Intelligence Mike Pompeo said as much in 2017: “It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is… a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia. In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence — the GRU — had used WikiLeaks to release data of US victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. And the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks.”
 
>The Assange saga is also a window into the scrambled ideological politics of the United States in 2019. The most fierce defenders of Assange come from two seemingly disparate ends of the ideological spectrum.
 
>First are the fans of Donald Trump, who understand that the leaks of Hillary Clinton’s emails were a political neutron bomb that exploded under her campaign in the closing weeks, the ultimate oppo drop.
 
>Joining them are the American Bernie Bros and the Glenn Greenwald demographic of America-can-do-no-good types who look at anything that weakens US influence in the world as a net positive.

"The Trump administration thinks it can slow or stop immigration through cruelty. Problem is, detention camps and family separation are nothing compared to the threat of cartels.

""**Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries**"", only when such crimes kill or assault or maim people, or create substantial and foreseeable risk of killing/assaulting/maiming people, extending that to 1030(a)(5)(A) (computer hacking)

"The only reason this is a thing now is because of how it ties back to Manafort, and because he was an Obama era person. They want to try and get him on the same ""did not register as a foreign agent"" that Manafort and Gates were accused of. 

**What was he doing?**

>Craig led a team of lawyers from Skadden, Arps who were commissioned by the government of Ukraine under President Viktor Yanukovich to look into errors in the trial of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko on abuse-of-power charges.

**How does this relate to Paul Manafort**

Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were responsible for the political lobbying in Ukraine that led to the arrest of Yulia Tymoshenko. They accomplished this by crafting anti-semetic as well as abuse of power narratives, and then spreading it through social media and key influencers.

Paul Manafort also gave Trump advice on how to discredit the FBI investigation. This would not only help discredit the Russia investigation, but muddy the accusations against Manafort as well.",politics
"Good? If they're corrupt, round 'em up. Doesn't matter what team they're on.",politics
Glad everyone wanted to release the investigation 😂,politics
"This has to do with Manafort, what do you mean?",politics
"This, uh, this is not that.",politics

When Assange starts working for a newspaper I'll start calling him a journalist,politics
"Trump calling journalists ""The Enemy Of The People""? THAT is an threat to journalists.",politics
"Gabbard: I, too, work for Vlad",politics
It's an absurd statement.,politics
Of course this fucking moron would defend this Russian spy,politics
Journalists have consistently been found to be within their rights to publish classified information. In fact I support Assange not being prosecuted for publishing the documents that he did (even the Obama DOJ concluded that this was not illegal). However if he helped Manning breach a classified system then he crossed a line that journalists are not supposed to.,politics
Of course she says that,politics
He's not a fucking journalist.  If he ever was he damn sure stopped being a journalist the second he had Manning hack into government computers for him.,politics
Assange is not a journalist.,politics
Assange isn't a journalist.,politics
"Not the hill to die on, Gabbard. For one, *he's not a journalist.* Running a website where you selectively publish leaks to protect your benefactors and harm the people who call you on your shit does not meet that standard.",politics
The only real democratic candidate.,politics
"Would you agree that the world is better off knowing the information they uncovered, even if they ""breached a classified system"" ?

Or do you think information related to US war crimes should have remained a secret?",politics
He's a journalist. He's just not under arrest for being a journalist.,politics
">The only real democratic candidate.

No.",politics
