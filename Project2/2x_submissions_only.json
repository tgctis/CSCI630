    "I stopped talking to my ex-boyfriend three months ago. I also made it very clear before I stopped talking to him that I wanted nothing to do with him and that he was not to contact me again. \n\nDespite this, he managed to stalk down a few of my Reddit accounts and send me unwanted messages, emails me through different emails to bypass my block filers, calls me from a blocked number, and even somehow found my Yelp account and sent me a message there.\n\nAlthough the messages are not threatening in nature, due to their unwanted nature it feels like harassment. Again, I had made it very clear that he was to leave me alone. I do not like this person and want nothing to do with them and have returned none of these messages,\n\nThat being said, what are my options? My friends and family agree he is harassing and stalking me, but feel there\u2019s nothing I can do. I feel there is likely little I can do either aside from changing my phone number, email address, and social media accounts, but wanted of be sure.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: US, Hawaii, [HI]", 
    "Posting from South East Michigan\n\nHello r/legaladvice,\nI have found myself in need of legal advice due to our neighbors' gas powered generator. Since December, our neighbors have been running a gas generator nonstop. The only times it is off is when they are refilling it with gas. Dealing with the noise for five months has been irritating, to say the least. However, we have not called the police because we have been worried that they have had no electricity due to unpaid bills. We have also been worried about getting law enforcement involved because we don't want to cause a rift between us and them.\n\nToday things got worse than just dealing with noise. Something has changed with the generator and the whole yard started smelling like gas fumes. Now, the gas fumes are getting inside our house. I know that the generator violates noise oridnances, but I feel like the fumes are a much serious issue due to health reasons. \n\nDoes anyone:\na.) Know what we can do legally to address this problem (especially with the fumes) \nb.) Have strategies to approach this issue to avoid escalating tensions any more than they need to be.\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.", 
    "So I was mailed a late notice Traffic violation caught on camera when I never received the initial warning. The location was at the intersection of Marcus Ave and Lakeville Rd in Nassau County going westbound. The video shows me turning right at a red when the seperate yellow turn arrow disappeared. I've never seen a sign on that corner saying I can't turn on red in my 25 years of living here in Long Island. A fee was also added for the late notice but I never received the warning to begin with. I am very thorough with my mail since I take care of all the bills for the house. What can I do to lower the fine or can I brush off a camera ticket? I'm not even sure how I can fight the late fee either when I never received the warning. I'm at a loss here. Any advice would truly help.", 
    "Hi, throwaway because this might be a recognizable  situation. I work for a tech startup in Ohio as a software developer, and I\u2019ve been working here for 2 years. \n\nMy equity in the company is supposed to vest (stock grant) on Tuesday. My employer is now threatening to fire me tomorrow unless I sign a contract extending my vesting cliff a year. Is there anything I can do? \n\nThanks for reading\n\nTl;dr see title", 
    "I live in an apartment complex in a small town in Washington and have noticed a tenant leaving large items, ie.    a kayak, tires, etc. on the curb above the complex. \n\nBasically they remove the items from their truck and \"store\" them here.  \n\nIt is a street above our complex where some people park but the property where the items are left is unowned. \n\nI have spent some time lately cleaning this area as people have always trashed it as it has a nice lookout over the town and is a popular spot for kids to go. \n\nCan I throw the items away? Should I tell the police?", 
    "I am in NYC. I gifted Estee Lauder daywear cosmetics to my wife. I bought it from Macy's in Herald Square. After using the product for a week, she noticed her skin was getting dry and itchy. She discontinued. Now her skin has peeled off. Areas look like it suffered chemical burns. \n\nWe want to sue Estee Lauder. Online reviews show we aren't the only ones having problems. Theres been stories of people rushed to the ER. \n\nAny recommendations? Should we seek out a class action lawyer? How about a plaintiff's side personal injury firm? What about consumer rights advocates? Or the FDA?", 
    "Thank you for taking the time to look at my post.\n\nThe details of the household shall remain private, full stop. The reasons behind their actions remain unknown, but for the purposes of this post aren't relevant.\n\n I am only interested in hearing about any Canadian Federal or Alberta Provincial laws potentially being broken here. I am doing my own research, and have already sent an email off to my lawyer outlining the situation as the title iterates, but I figured I would make sure that all my bases are covered and neither I or my lawyer are missing anything. \n\nIf you have any questions, please put them in the comments. I will answer as many as I can.\n\nThe housemate in question will be dealt with, legally, in short order. No advice is needed there, thank you.\n\nCheers, and thanks for the help.", 
    "Hey guys,\n\nI got a speeding ticket for going 5 mph above the speed limit. I am a Massachusetts resident but got pulled over in New York for speeding. I pled not guilty and my hearing is coming up. I don't know how any of this works. This is my first speeding ticket ever. Any advice would help, thank you!",

    "I need advice on a small claims matter with serving paperwork?\n I have tried everything for three months and the court clerks are no help, legal services didn't even want to bother with me, and a few lawyers I knew didnt want to help either, also all the Marshals I talked to pretty much said I'm screwed... I don't know what to do and it's starting to get very hard...\nMy question is with sending the certified letters. Because I have no address other than his father's address which he does not live at. People at work said he has been evicted from his place in Portland which there is no record of that address and he won't tell anyone cause he knows I'm hunting for him. Also the marshal in Portland found his dad's address for me and told me his current phone number was disconnected. I dont know any other phone number besides that. Also I have been told that the marshals can not use Facebook to contact a person. Marshals will not serve at EB (our place of work,) and the will not serve him at the base he goes to for drill. So my last option is to do it through certified mail which I have already done and it got sent back cause no one signed for it. \nSo with that in mind I was going to do the last resort option, which if legal, was send a letter to his father's residence and to his father's work (both he goes to on weekends) with his father's name and under it \"Attention: his name\" so that his father has no option to sign it and give it to him. As well as, if I can find the addresses, send one to his mother, grandmother, girlfriend, Sargent in his command, and bestfriend to get these stupid papers to him. \nI do not have the money to post it in two newspapers, which would be $400 to run the suit in the paper, and it technically does not count as serving. And I absolutely do not have the money to hire a PI, which would run me $1200. \n\nI have been hunting this kid and wasting my money to serve him these papers since January. I'm on the edge, running out of options and beyond frustrated. It's as easy as handing a supervisor the paperwork and having it handed to him that day. I'm losing my mind and I just want my damn money.", 
    "Basically what the title says. If I were to put a light up sign that when activated, showed a middle finger symbol, would it be illegal in any way. I live in Michigan btw.

    "When I was 19, I was caught smoking weed by my parents and they forced me to sign a contract on notebook paper that if I were to be drug tested positive, I would be taken out of university and made to enroll in a community college. Is this enforcable and would I suffer potential legal penalties for breaking the contract? As a note, I do not plan to live with them either way and be completely self dependent. At the time of signing the contract, I was living with them and dependant on them to live. For the sake of my peace of mind, assume my parents would try to pursue legal action.", 
    "So, my great uncle (My mother's uncle) lives in Kansas and I was wondering what the estate/housing laws are there. He has lived in the family house since it was built around 1940, his parents built it. He still lives there, no descendants no spouses. I assume it goes to the state, but could my mother or other cousins potentially claim the house or other things through legal/family representation? If possible how would one even go through the process? Since I live in TX, Would I have to do the 1-year residency thing there before even considering?", 
    "My landlord gave my personal phone number to one of my neighbors without my permission. So they could directy call me to complain about noise. (The noise complaits are for walking to the bathroom and flushing at 11:30 pm and other stupid not verry loud things.) Is my landlord alloud to do this? \n\nMontreal QC Canada.", 
    "My coworker got his car impounded last night and doesn\u2019t have a valid license to take it out. Would I be able to take the car out for him with my license? Does he need to be present?", 
    "I need some help navigating the law and my rights as a father. My son will be born in late June but my ex went insane, assaulted me, went to jail, and hasn\u2019t talked to me since. Do I have any rights until I get the court to order a paternity test and get legally established as the father? This is completely breaking my heart, is it true I don\u2019t have the right to have any part of his life until that is done?", 
    "I\u2019m California, married for five years, separated and for 6-7 months. Shit hit the fan in November, wife told to move leave the home and happily complied. I should note that the apartment is housing provided by her university. She\u2019s the student, but we have to sign the lease and all the yearly renewals. \n\nLong story short, she hasn\u2019t responded to my messages about money stuff. I wondered how she was going to handle the lease signature, cuz I had little interest in signing and hoped to use it as bargaining chip or a way to force a $ conversation. I googled and application deadline had passed. When I contacted the housing office, they told me that I\u2019ve already signed the lease. I\u2019m fairly confident that this means she forged my signature on the rental renewal form. \n\nWhat if any recourse do I have here? Is this like a major fuck up on her part or just like an administrative detail? I\u2019m curious, but pragmatic.", 
    "So I'm living with my bf currently and it's not working out. I'm concerned he won't move out when I break the news to him. His name isn't on the lease but he's been living with me rent free for a few months now (my landlord is aware he is living there despite his name not being on the lease as well). I believe this makes him a tenant instead of a guest. He doesn't pay for anything, he has no money I'm not sure if this matters at all. So if he refuses to move out will I be the one evicting him or would my landlord have to evict both of us?", 
    "I know that sounds awful. We\u2019re just researching it at the moment, not putting anything into action. \n\nAs a 19 year old Canadian, if I wanted to move in with an American friend who lived in Oregon to work as a cam girl online, what kind of visa would I need? \n\nI thought it would be a Tourist visa, but would camgirling be considered employment?\n\nEdit: okay so it seems it would be employment. Is there a way to get a visa that would cover that?", 
    "Simple, I was renting a bedroom with no lease. The person who rents the apartment let two more people move into my room without asking me. And still wanted half the rent.\n\nI left the house, and now I went bacl to grab my shit and they want $300. Had four people blocking me from opening the door with my stuff.\n\nDo I just call the police tomorrow and then they can make them let me grab it? It's literally everything I own except for my phone and wallet.\n\nThanks in advance. Currently living in Wyoming, USA.", 
    "So, after a long night of drinking, me and a friend (16) came up with the great idea to steal a card (I'm unaware of what kind of card it was) from a car and buy food from a nearby store. Afterward, we threw the card in the sewer and went home. I know how dumb of a move this was, and it is obvious that we would not have done this if we weren't under the influence. I will not do anything like this again and I was wondering what the chances of us getting caught were. We really regret doing this and feel bad for the victim. We have never done anything like this before and will face the consequences given. I just want to know what those consequences will be so I don't have to worry constantly.", 
    "Just for some context I am 17 and live in the state of California.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've filed multiple CPS reports against my abusive parents but they aren't doing anything. For the first CPS report, I called their hotline. When they sent cops over, I showed them recorded evidence of their physical abuse, which included my mother trying to attack me with a knife as well as her trying to attack my brother.  My parents, of course, denied any accusations, and all that happened was that they were offered some optional parenting classes. The abuse continued, so I made 2 more reports, both with a mandated reporter.  Both times, CPS didn't even bother to send over the cops or a social worker. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause any accusations of physical abuse are denied by my parents, can I use my mental health as an example of abuse, and potentially get transferred to an alternative living arrangement? Basically, I feel no empathy, and have a desire to set fires and torture animals. This is also accompanied by low impulse control and a complete lack of fear.  I'm not a doctor, but according to Google, these are consistent with a conduct disorder diagnosis. I do, however, know that these characteristics are a direct result of the abuse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat can I do?", 
    "hi \n\ni purchased a used vehicle a few days ago, I had been researching this style of cars for a long while, found a good deal (I thought) traded in my car for it   I  spent a lot of time looking at other places for cars like the one I found, and when we got home with the car, there were things that were not on the car as it was listed on the dealerships listing, XM, other options too.  Now I know we should have checked the car out, we just thought that since it was listed and I was familiar with (I had driven a few before I found this one) that the one we were about to purchase was as listed.   We paid cash for the car and we are wondering what our next course of action should be?  We did call the dealer (used car) and he said we were out of luck, since it was a \"As Is\" car.  We would like to stop payment on the car since it hasn't cleared yet.  Do we have any legal rights for this.  We live in Tennessee, I do know that since this was false advertising there has to be come sort of thing that can be done.  We will happily return the car (very few miles on it since we just purchased it 2 days ago) hope to get our money back and be done with it.   The dealership is a well know dealer and there are 3 dealerships in his name here, I am hoping that he wouldn't want a bad review.

    "Hello and thank you in advance for taking the time to read this..\n\nI'm  thinking of creating a website to help convert text into speech.  I'd  like users to be able to upload text files, pdfs, ebooks, etc.  and  they'll be able to get an mp3 link of a computer voice generated reading  of the text.\n\nI was curious to know if I  would be violating any copyright or might run into legal trouble before  I get started on this.   I would think it's similar to an image hosting  service, where the image host themselves are not liable if copyrighted  material is uploaded to their site.  I would not really want to  distribute the mp3 file in any way, just make it available to the user  and then delete it shortly after.\n\nAlso  wondering if it would be worth doing some kind of LLC?

    "Some background on the situation: I\u2019m in the military and was sent on temporary duty for about 6 months; it saved the military money by renting apartments over getting a hotel so we went with that. The company that we found to lease through seemed like a good company and had good reviews, offered furnished housing at a decent price.\n\nWe completed the leases with a clause built in that stated if we were unhappy with the apartment we were in, we could be moved.\n\nCut to move-in.... I get to the apartment and it\u2019s immediately evident that it\u2019s a one bedroom with an office nook that had a bed put into it. But I have no proof so I suck it up. My co-worker takes the only actual bedroom and I\u2019m in here.\n\nI email the rep we had worked with and immediately laid out a list of problems with a request that she move us. The list I sent was: \u201cA/C is broken, my bedroom has no doors, no window, no wardrobe or closet, and opens directly into the kitchen.\u201d\n\nShe replied with a promise to fix the A/C after I called her from a day of no response. Disregarding the bedroom. When I called back she stated that it had been rented out as a 2 bedroom in the past, but that she would do her best to find me a suitable replacement. She also said that if I felt it was a big enough issue I could bring it up with the city. \n\nAfter pestering her further she finally presented me with an option in another building that was actually 2 bedroom; with the stipulation that she couldn\u2019t move me in under 30 days because she could get a fine and lose her RE license. No where in my lease agreement is there a 30 day notice required, rather a 24 hour notice.\n\nFrom my own research I\u2019ve found that the apartment is in violation of fire egress laws, smoke detector regs, is in conflict with what the building itself is selling this apartment as, and the ad that was presented to us was also false.\n\nI\u2019m just looking for my best way forward on this. My other co-workers have good apartments and I don\u2019t want them to be kicked out for me causing a ruckus, but there\u2019s no way I can live here for another 5.5 months.\n\nI have pictures of my room, screenshots of my emails with her, screenshots of the ad and the building\u2019s website that mentions this apartment by number as a 1 bedroom.",

I'll tldr at the bottom. \n\nMy (M21) roomate (M20) went on vacation for two weeks and left me in care of their cat. They told me to feed, Water and clean the litter. Which I didnt mind doing because I care about the cat as well.  So I did.  Every morning I gave the cat food and water and scooped its waste before work. \n\nCut to now, they got home about an hour ago and started freaking out on me about how I neglected the cat and didnt care for it one bit. He claimed I \"over fed\" the cat because it puked once on his room floor. Dont cats puke often? He also claimed that the litter pan had a slider at the bottom that captured the urine which he ASSURED I wouldnt need to worry about that he said was \"completely full of piss\" although I scooped the shit every day and didnt notice anything. \n\nHe pounded on my wall screaming at me that I needed to clean the entire house right away because it was \"so dirty\" even though it was pretty much spotless except for dishes and a couple bags of garbage I was going to take out before bed. So he is throwing stuff around and starts packing his things and putting it in his car and leaves. He smashes a large chocolate cat a girl I've been talking to for like a week or two had left at my house, and tells me he'll get the rest of his things later and leaves. \n\n\nI have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

    "I was convicted of my second DWI in New Mexico in December 2016 (I have been sober ever since, if that matters). I was sentenced to have an interlock device in my vehicle for two years. I installed my interlock in the summer of 2017 when I was finally able to get a replacement car for the one I had totaled at the time of the accident. I waited far too long to get my interlock license, but I didn't think anything of it because it was due to expire in 2019, which would put me at the correct amount of time I was sentenced to have an interlock device in my car.\n\n\nFast forward to Janurary 2019. My boyfriend got a job offer in Illinois, and we packed up everything and moved quite suddenly. I spoke to my Probation Officer about moving and getting the device taken out of my vehicle just a few months early. She declined, saying it was out of her power. She advised that I stay and wait out the remaining months while my boyfriend moves without me. I tell her that is not an option. She says I could take the car if I could find someone who has the same interlock device service in IL. I tell her that there is no way I can drive my car almost 1,000 miles away. I ask her \u201cwhat if I leave my car with someone to take in to get serviced and come back in a few months when my interlock license expires?\u201d She tells me that that would work and to call the DMV in NM to check the status of my license.\n\n\nFast forward to April 2019. The DMV stated that even though my interlock license expired in March, I am still required to have an interlock license for another year. I was then told that I should really get going on reinstating my interlock license because if I wait too long, I will have to start over completely.\n\n\nAt this point, I am really looking for advice on how to just give this whole thing up. I don't need to drive where I am. I don't have a car in IL, so I don't need a license. I was sending money to NM to get my car serviced for just a few months, and now it's stretched beyond that time frame. I want to get the device taken out, sell the beater car, and wash my hands of this for now. If I come to a point where I need to own a vehicle and drive, then I will start my two years over wherever that may be, but for now, I just want my life back, and this burden off of my friends and family.\n\n\nShould I contact the Judge via written letter pleading my situation and ask for... ? I don't know... \n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thank you.",

    "Hello,\n\nI live in New York State.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently in a situation where I was watching my nephews for my sister full time as a \"child care provider\" for The Department of Social Services. Apparently there's an income based program that allows you \"Child Care Benefits\" which pays a child care provider (me) a standard rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt literally took her several months to get all her paperwork in that they needed and the process of getting approved to receive payments from dss just tends to take a few months apparently. So what they do is back pay you once everything gets finalized. They agreed to back pay me until December 18th. Thing is she worked a different job with less pay and less hours until the end of February. Starting in march she got a new job with better pay and much more hours. I assumed that when she started her new job she would no longer qualify for her child care benefits because of the increase in pay but to my surprise she told me that since her rent was so high she would still receive her childcare benefits. That meant that I would still receive the same rates from dss. Also that I would have to take on more hours of watching the kids but more hours equals more money so I happily agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo clarify I was watching the kids maybe 30 hours a week when she was at her old job. When she started her new job in march I began watching her kids 45 to 50 hours a week. Obviously I only agreed to the increase in hours because that meant that I would still be getting paid the same rates but for much more hours and therefore much more money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had been in contact with dss about the money that they were gonna pay me from the hours I had watched the kids while she was still working the old job which was for Dec. 18 thru Feb 28. I mailed out bills that I had to fill out and document all the hours and and money that they owed me based on the rates I had been given. March had gone by and they were still getting some final papers and stuff in from her so I just figured I'd hang on to my bill from march and just send it in with my bill from April(they pay month to month). At this point I still haven't been paid any money from dss but I was assured by them that they just needed some more papers from my sister then they would mail out my checks from December thru February. I didn't even think to ask about the hours I had been watching the kids during march and this month because in my understanding nothing had changed and she was still able to receive the same benefits as she did when she was at her old job. She explicitly told me this multiple times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, Last week I found out that she missed a deadline for turning in a document concerning her new job and they cancelled her child care benefits altogether. Moreover, she told me that she was never eligible for the same benefits she got while working her old job and that it was her case worker who told her that my pay rates would not change when she started her new job. I tried contacting her caseworker but she hasn't returned any of my voicemails yet. I'm hoping to get to speak with her this week. My sister is a compulsive liar (I'm not saying that out of spite or pettiness she legitimately has a lot of issues) and I'm almost positive her caseworker never told her that she still qualified for the same benefits at her new job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question is, what are my options here if any? Is there anything I can do to seek restitution or did I just get fucked over?",

The cops told the two of them to stay in separate rooms. He and I went in the computer room, she went in the bedroom. She then tried to enter the room we were in against the advice of the police. I was trying to shut and lock the door and she pushed her way in, repeatedly pulling my hair and slapping me. I did not press charges or even tell the police (hindsight is 20/20) since she agreed to leave willingly for the night and I just wanted it to be over. \n\nI terminated my relationship with her and after discussion with him, decided not to end my relationship with him. If he had ever expressed that he wanted me gone, I\u2019d have left in a heartbeat. It was messy, but we were working things out. We split up our time, an agreement she made willingly. This March, she left to go drink and then went to her moms. It was my night with him, so we were in bed. I was under the impression she was gone for the night, so I was sleeping naked. She came home wasted, ripped the sheets off of us, yelled at me, called me a homewrecker, and slapped me in the face. He then called the cops and this time I did press charges. They told me they couldn\u2019t arrest her since she didn\u2019t leave a mark, and suggested I file for a warrant at the court, which we did the next day. \n\nOn the date of the warrant hearing, we were given the opportunity to meet with a mediator and come to an agreement. I agreed to drop charges conditionally on her attending AA and therapy, her not defaming me to our mutual friends (I understand she needs to vent to someone, hence only mutual friends. She can say what she wants to her friends) and other conditions. If that agreement is not followed, I am free to resume these charges. Every condition I set was in the interest of her recovery and absolutely not revenge.

He did file a motion for discovery (actually it was titled a formal request for compliance with article 39.14...) At His first court appearence. But has since only reset repeatedly. I believe he was paid between  $2050- 2150 in total, but i can only prove $1150 of it with actual documentation.  He spent very little time duscussing the case, &  didnt really listen to me, nor did he explain any thing to me in a manner which i could clearly understand. And i dont think he believed me and Thought i was guilty. After catching another case. He filed a motion to withdrawl Council.  And it was granted. I dont feel like he helped me at all and hiring him was of no benefit to me. Would it be possible for me to get my retainer back? Or at least part of it? And how would i go about doing that? Pls comment or pm for more info requests. Thsnk you",

    "(United States, Illinois) So around December, when I was coming home from college for the holidays, I applied to Kohl\u2019s for some seasonal work. Shortly after sending in my application, I was able to set up an interview, so to me they appeared interested in having me fill a seasonal position. I go in for the interview, and before I am even allowed to speak to my interviewer, I was forced to sign up for a Kohl\u2019s credit card, as the employees claim that that is how they apply the employee discount. I fill it out having now been put under the impression that the interview would simply be a formality, as the very fact I am being asked to sign up for the Kohl\u2019s credit card means I\u2019ll be needing to use it for the employee discount. Then I go into the interview, where my interviewer only asks to tell her a bit about myself. Once I\u2019m done with my short list of facts about me, she tells me, rather frankly, that they would not be hiring me and they never planned on hiring me, as they finished hiring for seasonal positions more than a week prior. Do I have any legal recourse, or any way to report this highly unethical behavior? Or am I stuck with this credit card based on lies forever? Any advice would be much appreciated!\n\nTLDR: I was forced to sign up for a store credit card under the false pretense of an employee discount to gain access to an interview for a position I was never going to get. Seems at the very least extremely unethical. Any legal options available here?", 
    "A bit of a backstory: My mom and I needed new phones a year ago so my mom signed a 12 month contract with them for two lines, I hooked my card up with them and paid my portion of the bill every month until 8 months into the contract, Sprint had added extra charges every month with no explanation and secretly turned our contract into a 16-month contract without ever notifying us. Long story short my Mom could no longer pay the bill due to the extra charges and longer contract so she just stopped paying the bill and it ended up going to collections. Fast forward 3 months later, yesterday, I was notified of an attempted charge to my account by Sprint for the amount of the phones we had with them and the extra late fees we accrue. I cancelled the charge and reported it as fraud to my bank as I had never signed any contract myself. I also never saw this debt on my credit report and I never received any notice that I am liable for it. Is there a solid case here to fight these charges Sprint is trying to charge us? Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",

    "***Is this discrimination of a disabled person?***\n\nI've been offered a summer internship with a State of Texas governmental agency which requires a pre-employment drug screening and physical. The internship is mainly a desk job with possible trips into the field without any real physical requirements. \n\nThe medical center I went to required a fair amount of medical information including what prescriptions I take. Dr. A did not check any of my physical movement abilities. She only read my prescription list and she said she needed my doctors to fill out forms before she would sign off on the physical. I asked why and was told that she needed to confirm that I was under a doctors care because I was on \"alot\" of medication.  I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety and an irregular heartbeat many years ago. The first form from Dr. A is a \"Psychiatric Clearance\". The exact text is:\n\n\"I, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ examined the above named patient. His current condition will not interfere with safely performing his/her occupation and the patient is able to function at a level which has no limitations. The patient has no mental, nervous, organic or functional disease or psychiatric disorder likely to interfere with the ability to safely perform his/her occupation. Furthermore, the patient's current medications will not cause drowsiness or in any other way impair the patient from safely performing his/her occupation.\"\n\nThe way this is worded, I don't know if my doctor will sign it. \n\nDr. A gave me a second form. It is a \"Cardiac Clearance\" requesting a summary of medical history from the last six months and confirmation from my doctor that I wasn't going to pass out and my medicine doesn't cause drowsiness.

    "Hi LA,\n\nI used to work at a firm in Michigan before moving to another state. I moved to another state because I was dating a coworker (totally allowed within our employee handbook,) and she broke up with me. I did not take it well, and decided to quit and move. A few weeks after I did, she emailed me and asked the password to another account that we had. The thing is, I had told her multiple times where this password was located and what it was, and yet she never looked at it. I told her where she could go and what she should do to herself while there, and I guess she forwarded it our former boss\u2019 boss, and he sent me an email threatening to sue me for breach of contract. The thing is, I read our separation letter, and none of it included remanding company secrets, and even if it did, I instructed her multiple times as to where to find said password. I told them this, and have yet heard back. Am I in the wrong here? Am I subject to further legal action? Thanks",

    "Hello, I am going to ask our previous landlord for money towards our electricity bill.\nWe moved into the apartment January 2016 and lived there right up until beginning of December 2018.\nWe loved the apartment and took care of it. However the bedroom had a bad case of rising damp. It ruined my partners computer and a lot of my clothes and shoes.\nAfter 6 months of cleaning the mould and getting coughs and colds the landlord decided to buy an electric dehumidifier. This worked! However the dehumidifier used to fill up water quickly and had to be emptied every 20 hours or so. When it was full it would switch off and the humidity would reach 90 again within half an hour. We had to keep the dehumidifier on 24 hours a day 7 days a week 12 months a year.\nThis was from July 2017-December 2018.\nIn this time we weren't able to get a proper electricity reading as the meter was in the next doors flat. We knocked on a few times left notes etc and heard nothing. Told the energy company where the meter was and to see if they could get the reading for us. \nOn moving out we explained in another note we would need a ready ASAP. The lady who lived next door seem to think the meter wasn't in her house and said no in a note back through our door.\nWe explained all this to our landlord who eventually managed to get a reading for us. And after a lot of faffing gave our large deposit back as the apartment was spotless.\nWe give the ready to the energy company who tell us we owe \u00a32000! I was absolutely shocked! My partner and I set up a payment plan and I have decided to request the landlord pay some. We are still waiting on a calculation as we didn't start this process right away.\nMy partner has now just told me that we now only owe \u00a3600 because the energy company have re calculated the amount.\nOur contract with the landlord states that he is responsible for the up keep of the property. Which in my eyes means paying for the up keep of the dehumidifier?\nEven though the cost has gone down am I within my rights to request he contributes?",

I'll be 22 in July. \n\nI have endometriosis but can't get surgery because I am too young and it would be too dangerous (that was what my  doctor told me)\n\nI still have 2 years of college before I get my degree. \n\nI am very lucky because my grandma agreed to pay for my first year, and my dad helped me pay for rent and living expenses. I really owe them for helping me like that.\n\nThe problem is my dad's gf, who convinced him to entirely stop helping me as soon as i get a summer job (which i am still trying to find and it is really frustrating) because i am too old to not be financially independent. My grandma was already planning on only paying my first year so I already had my school to pay.\n\nSo here I am, 21, with a chronic disease (which they decided to not recognize), stressing out over how i am supposed to pay for my school + my rent + food + public transportation + life cost in general. I have barely enough to pay for my school but that's all. I was planning on getting a student job next year anyways, but as I live in Paris i know i won't make enough money to pay for everything...\n\nAlso, my dad is against loans so I can't get a student loan because he won't be my guarantor and I need one to get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently learned that in France, it is illegal to stop helping your kid (until 25 or 26yo) if they can't provide for themselves but I don't know how that works or how to even tell my dad about it because our relationship is quite awkward and low (i lost my mum when i was 17 and was closer to her). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat can i do ? do you have advices for me ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post.

    "Hey i am having huge problems right now. I work in a company with mostly immigrants. I am an American by the way. I got this job after high school. It pays well. So in the beginning it was good. Now it\u2019s just a mess. So pay attention to this. We work for production. We only get paid for the work we do. We work from. 7-5So for example we get a map there is 100 things in it we only do 20 we will only get paid for those 20 things. So if those 20 things only pay us 6 hours we would only get paid 6 hours for the day. First red flag. So on the map each job has time on it. We have a supervisor &amp; he puts the time for us. In the beginning we would get around 40-50 hours by Thursday. 3 weeks later all of sudden were only Getting 10-20 by THURSDAY. My GF ( not the supervisor ) is like family to me . We have a 8 man crew we are all like family. Me &amp; my brother are the only Americans. So the GF was telling us that hours are missing. We had this theory that someone is stealing time. We recently found out that the supervisor is the one stealing it. Once we\u2019re done with a map the numbers he messed with are back or EVEN BETTER THE MAP WOULD DISAPPEAR. Right when we\u2019re done with it poof gone. So no evidence for us. There is a lot of Supervisors that do this. They are called \u201cdead persons\u201d in my job. The supervisor put \u201cdead persons\u201d on the pay but the check goes to the supervisor. They don\u2019t put one they put THREE.  Now LISTEN TO THIS. My GF ( my boss ) called the OWNER of the company about what is going on, &amp; the OWNER SAID HE DOES NOT CARE WHAT IS GOING ON THAT HELL PAY US BACK FOR THE MISSING TIME BUT HE JUST WANTS HIS PERCENTAGE. He has promised to pay back missing time BEFORE to my crew never fu filled it. The people who are higher than us are  taking advantage because it\u2019s most illegals. What can the illegals do you know? So i want to step up &amp; help them be the voice for them. What can i do? There is a lot of illegal stuff in this job. I know my boss would know most of it.

    "I live in Iowa and I do armed security for a water treatment plant. It's not a bad job and I enjoy it. I work for a security company that provides armed security for the treatment plant. The one of the few downsides of the job is that they don't allow us to have a lunch break and it's often time difficult to get the chance to go to the restroom. So where I am, I'm at the entrance to the plant and separated from the buildings. So I work primarily alone due to being short staffed and they don't always overlap shifts. We do have a porta potty and it's alright for taking a leak in but to do my other business, it's much harder because I am 6'5 and 220 and I have alot of gear on and the porta potty is very small. And plus I have things that have to be done right on time throughout my shift and even being gone for 3 minutes gets you behind and you get in trouble. So it's very difficult to get the chance to go unless you're working with someone else. And that's only 1-2 times a week. And I often times work 12-16 hours per shift and I work roughly 50-60 hours per week so I work a lot of hours too. But at one of the close by buildings, they have a great bathroom but it takes 3-4 minutes to walk there and 3-4 minutes to walk back plus whatever time you're gone. So that's not an option unless someone is with you for a moment. As for my lunch break, they don't give you a break cause we eat as we work I guess. I've brought this up with my supervisor but I get a shrug and a deal with it. But it's sometimes hard to deal with it cause holding in my business can sometimes be painful to the point where I just go and deal with the consequences of getting behind. It's just frustrating and I don't want to blow this out of proportion cause I've repeatedly brought this up with my supervisor and his boss and they still say oh well, not my problem, go to the bathroom before you work. Which is difficult sometimes cause you don't always have to go before you leave for work. I just don't want to create a hassle for my boss because in the past, they have fired people for complaining too much about some parts of the job and replace them. In my opinion, I think I'm a decent employee and I think they wouldn't want to get rid of me but you can't ever be sure. I want to know if this is a violation of any regulations or something. I can't imagine it would be fair to anyone to do this to them. But if not, I'll probably start putting in applications elsewhere. Any comments or questions are welcome!",

I, myself, end up leaving the state, changing addresses and phone number several months later. fast forward two years and I get messages from exroommates saying she wants to send me papers to sign to get my name removed from the car. because of road toll payments she had missed which ballooned to hundreds of dollars and because of the missed car loan payment, I know it was being faulted under my name and messing up my credit score. at this time I didn't do anything to remove my name from the car loan and didn't know how. I've been suffering under depression and just ignored this issue hoping it would go away. so I thought removing my name from the car was great, until I get mail from car loan bank regarding a \"total loss claim\" and the car loan bank requesting confirmation of \"date of accident\" \"car insurance\" and my info. it also states I'm still responsible for unpaid amounts. the same day I see on her social media that she's shopping for a new car. now I think she had car insurance and has been paying it and so I thought the insurance money would go towards paying for that car. so my concern now is, she's planning on getting the check from the car insurance and using it to pay for a new car but skip paying for the totaled old car. since the car is under my name (her as the secondary), the car loan bank would come after me for not paying the rest of the debt. my question is, would car insurance send her the check since she's been making the payments or would they send it to the car owner (which would be me right?) I'm wary signing the paper relinquishing my name from the car, not sure if it would mean i am still obligated to pay off the car despite not owning it anymore, while she uses the car insurance payout to buy a new car. I want to put this nightmare behind me and say she intends to do well by me and get me uninvolved from it but like I said, she left without paying 6months worth of rent. my friend thinks since the car insured is under my name, car insurance will send me the check for the totaled car (Nissan Pathfinder 2011 - 86k miles at time of purchase). additionally, I'm concerned she could fake a call and impersonate me, often companies will ask some questions to confirm your identity and they'll ask for your social security number. well I suspect she took my home rental contract because its not in my box of paperwork (and im usually good at holding onto paperwork like rental contracts) and when you apply to rent, they ask you to put down your social security number. so I'm thinking she would have all she needs to impersonate my over the phone. location, Texas/NJ",

    "Hi all \n\nFirstly many thanks for taking the time to read this post, \n\nSo a bit of backstory before we get into the meat of things, we have four main characters in this labbeled as below\n\nM - Me\nF - fiance \nR - Mutual friend \nC - Harrasor \n\nThe just is that C is obsessed with R. R is not interested in C and does not wish for a relationship or any other arrangement to this effect. C' s obsession has caused him to make up malicious rumours about R including creating fake accounts spreading gossip and turning up at Rs house repeatedly uninvited, the last occurrence ended up in police removing C from Rs property. \n\nDuring this happening C has come to the idea that both M and F are the reason that he cannot be with R, however M and F have made it clear that we are staying out of this entirely and in no way play any role in Rs decision, \n\nThis has led to C harresing both M and F via texts Facebook messenger creating fake accounts voicemails and spreading rumors and making false acusations in an attempt to cause friction and tension in the relationship between M and F during alot of these voicemails he is audibly drunk. \n\nBoth M and F are more then content to ignore this block the number and move past it however C is using different numbers and different fake accounts to repeatedly message both M and F. Albeit not an ideal situation however M and F are content to just keep blocking the numbers and ignoring any attempts. \n\nThat was until today where C has made a fake escort account for F and to which they have now recieved multiple calls and texts enquiring about the service, it is unsure where this advert has been made however there is a fear that either M or Fs addresses have been used on this account potentially endangering the families of F and M. \n\nMy question is, what should be my next steps I have ensured to keep any evidence documents but how should I approach this to end this. M has had no contact with C so far and has ignored this rather then get dragged down, \n\nMany thanks again for taking the time to read this post, \n\nTLDR; Myself and fiance are being harassed by someone who is romantically interested in our mutual friend, this person has now raised an escort profile for my fiance who is now being harassed by text messages and phone calls from people visiting this escort profile",

    "Hey guys, this is my first time posting on this subreddit apologizes if this isn't suitable content. I am in need of some advice to give to my parents. Before I outline the issues, I think some background is needed before I start. \n\n>My parents immigrated from China to Australia in their mid twenties and have spent most rest of their lives here - now in their late 50s. Unfortunately, both of my grandparents from my paternal side have passed away during this time and have left an inheritance, their estate, for my father and his three other siblings. However, my grandmother was still alive after my grandfathers passing and as such received an inheritance as well - which has yet to be distributed. Additionally, one of my uncles wanted to purely received cash as his inheritance so he received that but now is waiting for my grandmothers.  \n>  \n>Ten years the ago the Chinese government made an offer to recover land which was privately owned by the public through relocation/purchase agreements to new apartment units of similar value for their land. My grandmother, father and his siblings accepted these terms and subsequently were given two apartment units that was equal to their inherited lands worth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the issue at hand. To avoid getting some taxes and refine insurance policies my uncle and aunt want to consolidate the ownership to one person for each of the properties. On the original registry of each property there are four names; my grandmother, my father, my uncle, and my aunt (don't know if there has been any alternations due to my grandmother). Due to us not frequently traveling back and forth between China it basically \"their house\" in term of everyday life. Currently, my uncle and aunt are both retired and do not have the liquid equity to purchase the share of the inheritance of my father and are unwilling to sell the property as their well established there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are pressuring my father, who is the youngest of their generation, to sign over his shares of the properties to allow them do the what I said above. They are simply verbally agreeing to guarantee that my father still has ownership of the properties which is a concern. As my aunt has retracted her promises and words before against my father who has loaned money back home to my grandmother when she was alive which was then given to my aunt who my grandmother told is a loan from my father but we have never seen a cent back from her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe end result which my immediate family would like is to receive our share of inheritance in cash to be used for our everyday life in our country. However, due to my relatives not having the liquid equity I personally advised my parents to get my aunt and uncle to sign a contract identifying they are loaning our assets in the form ours shares before they sign the transfer of property ownership. What are some methods that could be employed to resolve this issue?",

    "TLDR: Signed a lease to a dirty house owned by a family friend before approving after it was \"cleaned\".  Went to move in and the cleaning done was almost nothing. currently want to just break the lease. Am I screwed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll start by saying i feel very stupid about this whole situation already I'm just checking to see what my options are. \n\nFiance and I are planning on moving into a house in a town closer to where we grew up which is over an hour away from where we currently live. We found a house online that just so happened to be owned by someone who my fiance knew from high school and I actually worked for his parents when I was much younger so there was a general level of comfort moving forward that he would take care of us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we first were shown the house it was apparent the old tenants didn't take care of the place too well it had a pretty bad cat smell, cat hair almost every where and just generally needed a good scrub down everywhere. This was about a month before we planned to move in. he assured us he had cleaners lined to take of of everything and the cat smell would be professionally taken out. I wasn't super impressed just because of how much of a mess it was but was interested in how big the place was and it was in a really cute part of town. At this time we didn't commit thinking maybe something better might pop up. after a week of searching with no better options popping up we told him we would like to see it again. After a week it looked like they hadn't touched the place yet, he said they had started on the cat smell but i think by that he meant opened some windows. he again assured us he wanted to get the floors chemically cleaned before doing anything else. We were kind of getting short on time with our current lease running out so we told him we were interested but because of the state of the place weren't ready to sign anything. After a couple weeks of waiting it came to the week before we were planning on being out of current apartment and the owner of the new house wanted us to get paperwork done before we moved in and just so happened to attend college in the same town that we currently lived in. We tried to set up a time to meet in the house to sign paperwork and give the house a once over but nothing worked out so we ended up meeting him on campus I did probably the dumbest thing i've done in my life. I signed the lease and gave him a check for deposit as well as first months rent. His reassuring tone that it would be move in ready and my wanting to be able to easily move from our current apartment to the new house seamlessly got the better of me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we showed up to start moving in the house looked exactly the same except the hardwood on the main floor had chemical residue on it which your shoes stuck to as you walked and the upstairs carpet looked like they shampooed with out vacuuming at all. Cat hair everywhere cat smell still present now with chemical smell. pulled the oven to the side and dust cigarettes cat hair and a tampon (unused). clothes washer had mold. dryer was missing lint trap and was full of lint. Overall still pretty gross. Something new that i noticed was that the vents were absolutely caked with hair and dust and looks like something that needs to be professionally cleared out. we didn't move anything in because i thought it was unnacceptable. I had him come over and pointed out all the issues and asked why it hadnt gotten done. he said he was told it had gotten done but he hadnt seen the place yet. I asked him not the cash the check and that we wanted everything cleaned before we moved in. I am honestly wanting out of the lease but am afraid that since i signed that he might not let me out. Do I have any right to break the lease if he told us that the place was ready but it clearly wasnt? While expressing my unhapiness one of his excuses was that he was letting us move in early. Again I feel very stupid about the whole situation but am just stuck because now we had to move all of our stuff to our parents places (luckily they live close by). We were there ready to move in on saturday 4/27 and we told him we wanted it clean by the first which is when our lease technically starts. if things aren't very clean by the first do we have any recourse to break the lease?", 
    "On a nice Saturday afternoon, two young neighborhood kids knocked on my door and asked if I had any work they could do for me. I asked a few questions and gathered that their parents were tired of getting their requests for money so they shooed them away, telling them to go bother their neighbors with such requests. The kids want the money to buy toys and games and stuff like that. I didn't gather their age, if I had to guess I'd say maybe between 10 or 12.   \n\n\nIn this instance I didn't have any chores front and center so I wished them well and sent them off. Later on I did think of some tasks around the yard they could do. Basically, picking up sticks and weeds. Nothing involving power tools or sharp objects. On the off chance such a request surfaces again, I'd like to know more about what legal considerations, if any, I should be aware of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, I've heard of child labor laws, and believe they exist for good reason, but I'm not a lawyer and don't know if such laws would apply to neighborhood kids actively looking for a neighborhood job? Would I be putting myself at risk by hiring a neighborhood kid to do some menial task - at their request? Is there information that I would need to gather before agreeing to pay a neighborhood kid - e.g. no hiring anyone under the age of 13? Would there be any sort of tax implications or record keeping for paying out a small amount, say under $20? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bottom line is my sense of it is that this sort of thing happens all the time, but I would like to understand what risks and pitfalls exists before engaging. The last thing in the world I need is to get in ANY sort of trouble for hiring some neighborhood kid for a task that I genuinely could easily do myself.", 
    "Friday night my girlfriend went out and got a citation for public intoxication. Her friends said the cop never took her blood alcohol or gave a sobriety test or took her in. On the citation the officer got the last digit of her ID number wrong and wrote the wrong zip code. My girlfriend gets panic atracks and has anxiety she has a prescription for it but was feeling better this month so stopped taking them. she had a panic attack at the restraunt and ran out the restarurant and  said she blacked out and just remembered the cop cuffing her. she is on probation for a DUI which was dropped but for some reason the county where she got it still says she needs to do probation. she is 2 months from finishing her probation and got this Friday. Saturday morning she called her probation officer and left a message for her saying she got into a situation this weekend, before we say that the cop wrote her info wrong. What is the best course of going about this?", 
    "At the Houston Astros stadium, I walked out of the team store with a hat on my head ($30) value. next thing I know the police say they have it on camera and issued me a ticket with a court appearance date.

    "All events are taking place in Chicago.\n\nI (26f) removed my ex boyfriend (27m) from my home last August after he paralyzed my cat by throwing her. He said it was an accident but it broke me to watch my cat drag her hind legs and piss herself. Afterwards I realized how empty my home was and let my best friend (21f) and her boyfriend (23m) occupy the other room. Soon after that my friend and I found out one of our coworkers was an emancipated minor aged 17 who was struggling with a place to go since he had came to Illinois from Michigan. We moved him in and I gave him my room with a lockable door while I slept in the smallest room which held all my important things. Things were generally okay up until my ex returned in January.\n\nHe demanded I let him back into \"his house\" and called the police. They told me that since he had resided here for over a year he had \"squatter's rights\" and generally sided with him and made me feel like some cruel woman who wanted him to freeze to death. He moved all his things in and demanded his room back. I had to move the other couple into my tiny room and I was going to sleep in the living room on a makeshift bed. \n\nThen my ex realized the 17 year old was sleeping on our old bed and he literally lost his mind and started jumping to conclusions. I had to literally hold my ex back as he tried breaking the door down to the room where the 17 year old was sleeping. My ex then ran out and disappeared for a few hours, I went to my job and told the others to hang tight. That night, as my shift was ending, I saw my ex waiting in the lobby of my job with the 23 year old roommate. After my shift we sat down and talked and tried to come to some sort of agreement, but my ex kept demanding I remove the 17 year old, and that I sleep with him on our old bed in our old room.\n\nI rejected the idea, and later that night when my ex and I were alone he beat and strangled me behind my job. He fled after that to North Carolina, but returned around late March/early April, and has made my life a living hell. He has followed all of us to work, stalked us, thrown things at us, and broken into my apartment when no one was there. The final straw for me and my job was when he showed up during each of my work days to find me. I had to quit. Later on the 17 year old also quit after he was almost pushed into traffic by my ex while he was walking to work. Then he hacked into my internet account and my router and he would regularly check and track who had left the house and who stayed in by watching our phones disconnect and reconnect from the wifi. One day he came and threatened my friend and her boyfriend with a hatchet. Soon after that he literally kicked our door down and broke the locks befire running. \n\nThen, one night, as my friend and her boyfriend had gone to California for a few days, the 17 year old and I were cooking and I recieved a message from my ex stating that he knew we were home, he had a rifle, and \"irreversible damage would occur\" if I didn't comply with him. I called police, showed them my order of protection and 3 other police reports, and they rushed the 17 year old and I to my parent's home for safety.\n\nNow, while we were here my ex came to my parent's house while they were out at work and demanded I come outside. I panicked, called police, and once they arrived I explained the situation. At this point he was still at the end of the block and the police...refused. To. Do. Anything. He smiled, flipped me the bird, and rode away while they shuffled through my paperwork just to tell me that he hadn't been served the order of protection. \n\nNow, even as I type, my ex keeps messaging me threats of breaking into my parent's house and all these angry hate filled messages about how I'm delusional. I am scared. What the hell can I do here legally to get him arrested?\n\nTl;dr- ex boyfriend got kicked out for harming my pet, I moved in some roommates, he assumes I'm having relations with one of them on our old bed, he threatened all of us, I ran to my parent's home, now he's threatening to find me here and break in. I called cops once and they literally let him ride away on his bike.",

    "Hello,\n\nI work for a very large company in the financial services industry.  As a hint to exactly what we do, we're in the business of paying as little money as possible at a time.  I've been very sick of this job for a long time and I am looking at different opportunities out of the industry.  As a result, I've been doing a lot of research into what happens at termination of employment.  In all of my jobs previously, I have received a payout for all of the PTO I had accrued, even my high school job working part time at a nursing home.  I never take time off, and I have a substantial bank of this time built up, so it would be a financial boon to receive this payout.  \n\nI became concerned because I've heard from many people that my employer does not pay PTO at termination, so I decided to look up the company policy.  It states that the company does not pay out PTO at termination except when it was required by the jurisdiction.  Naturally, I then looked up the laws for my state.  The Department of Labor's website states that any accrued vacation time will be paid out at termination of employment in acccordance with the employer's contract.  It sounds as if the two are punting off to each other somewhat, but it also seems to me that my employer really should be honoring the payout where the state's policy indicates it.\n\nI recently received definite confirmation that PTO is not paid out at termination from the employer but was not provided a reason.  The impression I'm given is that because the employer classifies accrued time off as \"PTO\" instead of \"vacation time\", that particular law doesn't apply to them.  I've contacted my state senator as well as a former DOL commissioner for my state to help provide some clarification on the policy, but I have yet to hear back.  There are a number of job opportunities I would like to pursue, but I would like to know what my options are before doing so.\n\nIf I don't receive any response prior to leaving the employer, do I have any legal standing?",

The guy blamed my husband and refused to give him his insurance information, stating he needed my husband's only. Then he started saying that instead, my husband needed to buy him paint.

    "Hey guys,  \n\nHere's my situation. I live in NY and my ex and I are going through a pretty rough break up. He's being some what retaliatory and I don't have any actual credible information that he would mess with me once he formally moves out, but he has been acting very unpredictably and once he's gone, I would like to have a lease that's solely in my name.  \n\nAs it currently stands, we started a lease in November 2018 that was due to end or renew in April 2020 and both of our names are on it. His new lease starts May 1st and he should be all moved out some time this week. I haven't approached him about signing some kind of release so my landlord and I could create a new lease for myself, but I'm concerned he will refuse to, if anything, just to make things more difficult for me. I'm still going to ask and try, but I was wondering if there's anything I can do to keep him out legally. Since he's still on the lease, he could technically wander in at any point.  \n\nAny thoughts or advice in this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

    "Hello,\n\nI believe my now husband may have only pursued a common law marriage with me in October 2018 in the state of Colorado to set himself up to secure COBRA benefits as my spouse after my planned departure from work in December 2018 for sabbatical. He was unemployed at the time, and was on my health insurance previously as my domestic partner. Around open election period in October 2018, he suggested transitioning on health insurance to my spouse as a step toward securing common law, with the explanation he was ready to legitimize our relationship. We had been talking about starting a family around that point, so I was thrilled, because I loved him and wanted to take this step as well. I had no reason to doubt his intentions.\n\nHowever, after I left my job in December, I purchased health insurance on the open market but he was adamant about electing COBRA benefits. I didn't think too much of it; he has a chronic condition and I figured it was simply the cheaper option. It took him three months to finally enact COBRA (bit of an adminstrative nightmare for him), and in March 2019 his coverage resumed.\n\nCome tax time in March/April, we filed taxes as married. He was insistent on filing married but separate, which I thought was strange given we have shared finances in our primary home, but didn't contest too much because filing jointly wouldn't have changed my tax bill. He has a pre-relationship rental property in which I'm not financially involved, and I assumed his push to file separately was for more efficient management of that property.\n\nHowever, after filing taxes as married 3 weeks ago, and during that time discussing extensively with him the implications of filing as married to make sure he was comfortable with it (it's a big step; I was very excited but of course wanted to make sure he was happy too) and him telling me with certainty it's (legitimizing our relationship) what he wants, he now wants a divorce and to end our relationship completely. Literally 3 weeks later. This has come absolutely out of nowhere. He's not willing to consider counseling, mediation, etc. He simply wants an uncontested divorce now, and for the relationship to be over. I'm devastated.\n\nI thought we were establishing common law marriage to secure ourselves before starting toward having children. He assured me repeatedly we were on the same page. I now feel completely lied to, possibly used, and have no idea what the legal implications are here. I never would have agreed to marriage had I known he wasn't 100% genuinely on board with continuing to build a life together.\n\nDo I have any legal rights in this situation? Any legal risks/liabilities? I have no idea what to do.", 
    "My Ex and I have been officially divorced since February, and around that time she started seeing a new boyfriend. When she first met him she said she heard rumors that he used cocaine, and that it would be a deal breaker if he did. Recently I asked her about it again, and if she found out if he was using drugs. She assured me that he did not and that the rumors had no base.\n\nI wasn't convinced, so I asked around and did some snooping. \n\nI have taken pictures of instant message conversations between them. I found information that strongly suggests that they are both using while my children are staying with her. I can only say strongly suggests because they, of course talk in a vague code. They never specfically say the word \"cocaine\" it's always \"a bag\", \"the stuff\", etc. But there are other context clues that lead me to believe that they are talking about coke and not any other drug. \n\nGetting access to these messages required me to sign into her account, and I don't want to incriminate myself just to have my evidence dismissed. The one thing I might have going for me is that she had signed into an old computer that I still own. It hadn't been turned on since the divorce and still automatically pulls up her account. \n\nThe only other \"proof\" I can offer is that I have seen her acting in a way that matches the behavior of someone high on cocaine, and my oldest daughter has noticed a change in her personality in the past months.\n\nIf I \"accidently\" accessed her account due to automatic login, would reading these messages be more legitimate than if I had gotten to them another way? Also, is there any other way to prove that she is using? I can't imagine she'd volunteer for a surprise drug test, and since cocaine is out of your system relatively quickly, it might even be hard to catch it then.",

    "I'm in Georgia and broke my finger early March. I went to urgent care and the doc put it in a makeshift splint; however, the break was on my knuckle and a few colleagues have suggested it shouldn't have been immobilized (mind you, none of these are doctors \\[I do have doctor friends I could reach out to if this argument seems viable\\]). Potentially as a result of immobilization (super not a doctor and the knowledge I do have does not extend to joints), the bone healed incorrectly and as my physical therapist put it, \"was hard as cement\" when I started with her. My finger, formerly incredibly nimble, will most likely still retain some stiffness and definitely will without physical therapy; however, my insurance does not cover a significant amount and as a result I'm not sure I could proceed with as many sessions as needed. I'm aware of the necessary requirements to file malpractice on the first doctor - the only thing I'm lacking is the hand specialist saying it was treated incorrectly from the start.

Wife moved to Texas because his next duty station was set to be there, so he could maintain a relationship with the kid.  He decided not to re-up in the Army and moved back to Michigan.  She liked Texas, so she stayed.\n\nFather was absent for most of the kids life.  Custody paperwork laid out when he was suppose to get her (alternating christmas and thanksgivings, spring break, 8 weeks over the summer).  He rarely saw her, rare called, etc.\n\nFather was court ordered to provide health insurance, but never did.  (child ended up on Medicaid because mom was barely scraping by).\n\nI met mom and kid in 2015.  Liked them both a lot.  Things went great.  Now we are married with 2 more kids together.  Stable house, good job, etc.\n\nSummer 2016, child goes to Michigan for his summer visits.  Child is upset but goes along.  When she comes home, she has gained a ton of weight.  Lets us know she basically ate McDonalds the whole summer, because that's all he would feed her.  Had her sleeping on the couch all summer and bounced her from one place to another all summer (whichever relative they were staying with at the time).\n\nAfter this summer, father files some paperwork through the Friend of the Court in Michigan.  Telephone hearing was held, custody was changed to give him 10 weeks during the summer.  Agreement is made that the child would be able to fly to Michigan instead of original plan to meet at the Texas border.  Father would be responsible for all airfare costs.  Father also agreed to call twice a week to talk with child and maintain a relationship.  (I don't know what all was said, but my wife said she was never given a chance to plead her side of things.  Every time she talked, the FotC would cut her off, and let father talk more).\n\nSummer 2017, he flies her up there again.  She ends up spending most of her time at maternal grandma's in Michigan.  About 5 weeks into his time, child's mother and I fly up to visit her family to let them know about pregnancy.  Child pleads with her bio father and they argue a lot, and he agrees to let her come home with us.\n\nSummer 2018, child asks father to let her stay in Texas for until after Girl Scout Summer camp.  He agrees, and she flies up there after.  Again, she doesn't stay the whole time.  They argue a lot, and we end up flying child back down early.\n\nChristmas 2018.  Child is now 11.  He buys her plane ticket (as unaccompanied minor) to come visit him.  Child refuses to get on the plane.  Mother and airline tries to talk her into boarding, pilot even gets off the plane to talk her through it.  She is bawling and refusing to get on the plane.  Airline says they won't force her on.   Her flight is rebooked until later in the day, to give another chance.  Next flight, child still refuses.  Does not want to see her father.  Says she hates him.  Rebooked to the next day.  Child refuses at the terminal again.  Airline says that was the last chance.  Won't rebook again.  Airport police brought over to document everything so there is a report saying that mother did everything she could.\n\nThroughout the whole process, father would rarely call.  MAYBE once a month.\n\nNow, today, father texts saying he is going to file paperwork for all his missed time and because mother doesn't \"encourage her to have a good relationship with her father\" he is filing for custody.  Mother doesn't badmouth him at all.  Does her best to stay 100% neutral on everything.  Lets them talk every time he calls at a responsible time (before 9pm).  He also wants to sue for $3500 reimbursement for of plane tickets from child refusing to get on the plane.  He is asking when she gets out of school for summer (this information has been provided multiple times already, and he was recently (this past week) told how to find a school calendar online to have all dates.\n\nWife just texted me as I was typing this saying she has a consult with a lawyer after lunch.

The new owners will be coming to pick them up on Wednesday, so hopefully they have a better life after this. The only Orgs that contacted me back were the ones that didn't deal with animal abuse/neglect to let me know they can't help, which I appreciated. I'm pretty upset about the lack of response from the SPCA. They haven't contacted us at all since the day before they said they would come out to investigate. I don't know, maybe one or 2 of the chickens could still be alive if they did. \n\nApparently the wife is upset and going crazy about getting rid of the remaining ducks but she literally not once has left her house outside of going to work. She has never ever gone back there with the ducks and chickens. I'm pretty sure she has hoarding tendencies at this point and her husband enables her. The husband didn't seem at all phased we called the cops on him. I think he's just done with the whole situation to be honest.\n\nSo I failed at saving those poor chickens but I like to think since the cop came out that they decided to get rid of the ducks. So while the cop didn't seem to care at all about the situation and he just had to be here because it's his job I'm still thankful he showed up because I think it helped scare the neighbor.", 
    "Hey there,\n  My ex will not stop listing our daughter as a dependent on his taxes ( he has done this the past 5 years). TY 2018, he gave me $160( less than half for a Nintendo Switch) & he saw her 27 days out of the entire year.

    "My neighbor across the hall told me about this. They said he knocked and when no one answered opened the door. Yelled maintenance but when I got home no work had been done in here.

    "State is Colorado. I lived in a small condo/apartment that was owned by my land lady/roommate. I\u2019m a neat person, but she was obsessive and difficult to live with. \n\nShe gave me 30 days to vacate the property mid April because she was moving and wanted to rent to someone else. She stated if I returned the common areas of house (living room, kitchen, my bathroom and bedroom) in its original condition, I\u2019d get my deposit back.

    "Hi all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust moved out of a property. The Agent would like to take some of our bond because of dammage to the property.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of this dammage was caused by the actions of one of the people living in the house (he dammaged the walls in his room).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever some of the other dammage can be (in my opinion) more accuratly be described as 'decay'.

    "I did something colossally stupid and ended up on a website (theChive). Is there a way for me to get it taken down, ASAP? My face is clearly in it. It\u2019s a screen capture from Tinder. Any help here would be appreciated.", 
    "TL;DR:  Started a plan in February for veterinary services.  Paid in full for the year.  Company was purchased in April.  Now, all scheduled visits have been cancelled, plan is not honored, and we're being directed to the previous owner to discuss refunds.  \n\nLonger version: I have 2 new puppies.  Prior to 6 months old, puppies can be enrolled in a wellness plan (to include spaying/neutering) for roughly $600 per dog.  After 6 months, this plan will not cover spaying/neutering ($200-400 per dog).  We enrolled our dogs at 3 months old with our local vet.  Our goal was to complete their spaying in April, and to pay additional costs to have our dogs boarded while we completed a family vacation.  \n\nEverything was going fine, scheduled, and on track up until 3 days prior to the vacation.  We received a call from the vet informing us that it was under new ownership and management and that our boarding and spaying that was scheduled was cancelled.  We were luck enough to find family to watch them, but came very close to cancelling our vacation due to this (additional note:  To board dogs, certain vaccines must be given.  As it turns out, the vet missed one dose during a March visit, meaning no vet or boarding facility would be able to intake our puppies.  In retrospect, it looks as if they had other things on their minds). \n\nNow, post trip, we've received a follow up call from the vet.  They are no longer honoring the wellness plan (already paid in full for).  If I were on a monthly payment plan, this would have just terminated at that point and I'd only be out 2 months of payments.  Financially, the only issue would be enrolling them on a new plan at a different facility and being stuck with the bill for new enrollment costs and the added burden of price hikes due to them being over 6 months old.  Unfortunately, I paid in full up front.  The response was \"You'll have to take that up with the previous owner.  He'll reach out to you\".  \n\nIn my (obviously, IANAL) opinion, the business owners who purchased the facility are responsible for the contracts made at that facility.  Their records show that we paid for the annual service in full.  In NJ, is this true? \n\nI am now out 1200 bucks and am stuck paying (essentially) a penalty when I establish similar services elsewhere due to my dogs' age.  Assuming I were fully reimbursed the 1200 paid in February, I'd still be \"upside down\" as all services rendered in February and March have to be redone with a new vet.", 
    "I've been trying to figure out what to do about this and I could really use some advice. I'm currently 25 and back in January of 2017 I was touring some apartments in a city that I thought I was going to stay in at the time. During this time I came across an apartment I really liked, it was a new complex with literally all college students, which is what I was at the time. During my tour the person working there said I should go to their website and \"fill out the application\" to try to reserve a certain unit. I went and did this and I remember just clicking through it and not paying a ton of attention to what I was doing, thinking it was all just a simple application. I came to a last page and remember doing an e-sign (I'd never heard of this before). I did it, just thinking it was the application.\n\nA couple days later, due to unforeseen events I found out I'm not moving to this city all together. I call the person helping me telling them I didn't need that unit after all and to not worry about my application. She looks me up and says I apparently already signed a lease. I told her that can't be right and I race to their front office. I talked to the manager of the place and essentially told them it was a careless mistake and I'm no longer even moving to the city. She pretty much told me too bad and was really rude about it. From then on I wrote letters to the complex explaining the mistake, also wrote letters to the collection agency telling them what happened. I got nothing but a collections for it sitting on my report\n\nI've had this on my credit report since then and it's weighing down my score and available credit. I now have a great paying job and I've had a Delta Amex with a credit limit of $1,000 for 6+ months now, which I really want a larger limit. I have a minor sized student loan. I haven't missed a payment and pay everything off every month. But this collections charge is a big weight on my report, keeping my scores and credit limit down, along with preventing me from getting certain cards. What do I do to get this off my reports?",

    "Hi everyone, and thank you.\n\nSo, to make a long story short, I work for an academic institution in FL. There's one little setup that's different: I work for a center than basically self-manages. We work in another location from our campus, do not have in-house HR, and basically rely on the university just to issue paychecks and provide legitimacy. \n\nLast year I approached my bosses about doing a H1B since my student visa would expire in about a year. They agreed to sponsor me. Two months later, 3 people out of 7 quit, and due to my performance, they approached me with a promotion to a management position. I accepted, saying that since they were taking a huge load off of my shoulders, I could do the same and help. \n\nI was told that there would be no promotion since the money that they'd give me for the promotion would go into the H1B sponsorship. They said the policy of the college is to pay for everything, so considering I would not have to contribute a penny for a legal case, I said okay. Another two months later, at which point the case has been submitted to DOL for the Prevailing Wage Determination, we are supposed to get new business cards and I am informed that my old title, not my new one, would go on the card. I checked with my immediate supervisor, who said that I had received the promotion, but I had to train for it and then it would show on the official forms. It's important to mention that I was doing the responsibilities of the new position effective immediately, and by the time that the lawyers were notified and the case was submitted, I had been doing the job for at least 1 month, most likely 2. I will note here that they have a history of offering promotions but not raises like this: by getting people to agree to extra responsibility and telling them they'll pay them when they prove themselves worthy of the promotion. It's actually the reason why 2 of the 3 people that left, left.\n\nAnyways, so I look through all HR platforms, and indeed, the job listed is my old one. Fast forward to 5 months later. My directors get me into a meeting and tell me that the PWD has failed, due to the fact that I make much more than my old position would make (my starting salary, which is what everyone else in our center makes, with my old title as their title), and that because of that, they cannot proceed with the case, and that I am basically on my own to make this right. I ask whether they tried appealing on the grounds that our job is significantly different from others in the field (we work with a notoriously difficult population, which is why our entry level salaries are significantly higher than the general), and they said no, because the difference is too great to make up. I ask them whether they can refile or ammend with my updated responsibilities, and they say they do not have another 5k to waste on me. I speak with my direct supervisor, and she tells me my \"training\" has been placed on hold, but I am to continue with my new job responsibilities. \n\nLonger story short, I have come to the conclusion that considering our distance from the university, and considering how this all went down, my in-house managers did not inform the relevant HR people about my promotion, and as a consequence, they did not give my updated responsibilities to the lawyers, which in turn caused my PWD to look weird and fail. I think this is because of the fact that the position they offered me makes much, much more (like 10-15k more) than my current one does, which they would be forced to pay me if DOL is alerted to it. It is a very well known fact in the office that our budget is weak, and I suspect that they hid stuff from HR as a way to both get their short-terms needs met, and keep me long-term. However, I don't think they anticipated the application would fail like it did, and I don't think they anticipared I'd catch whiff of things before they happened. \n\nI have evidence to support my claims, of course, but I do not have access to my actual application materials, on account that HR + lawyers prepared everything. I think that I can successfully sue if I can prove that the lawyers and HR did not know of my promotion if I can get my hands on the application the lawyers sent on my behalf - where my responsibilities would be losted - but I don't know if asking for my materials would raise about 100 red flags or if it would be considered well within my legal rights. There's much more to the story, including threats and emotional abuse, so I am really committed to seeing this case through until the end. \n\nTL;DR: I have reason to believe my immediate supervisors did not inform HR and my lawyers about my actual job responsibilities, which would have eventually forces them to give me a raize. Can I, or how can I, request the paperwork submitted by the lawyers to verify that everything was done properly?", 
    "Long story, BUT **I had a printed ticket with seat number** 14E for flight AA2483 from Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) to Ronald Reagan International Airport in Washington DC (DCA) for April 28, 2019 at 1:25pm arriving in DCA at 5:14pm. As I was about to board at Gate C12 at DFW, the gate agent (a woman with light olive skin and dark hair tied up in a ponytail) **scanned my printed ticket and said that someone else was already in my seat. They barred me from boarding and would not explain what had happened to me or how I would be able to get home**. This was around 1:20pm.\n\nAs I tried to get an explanation from a male gate agent named Pharoah (medium tint skin, curly hair, wearing a grey cardigan), he refused to talk about what had happened and said that I wasn\u2019t in the system. **As I stood near the boarding area, he started pushing and shoving me until I eventually broke down. He started threatening me and attempted to shove me between a glass door. I had to call the airport airport police about the situation.**\n\nAfter the airport police showed up, they diffused the physical altercation. They led me to the floor manager by the name of Ting (Straight dark hair, medium-light colored skin, wearing a light blue blazer). She was at the same gate, C12. **Instead of giving me an explanation of what had happened, she saw my cellphone and asked if I was recording. She said that she would not help me if I had a cell phone near me. I showed her that I was not recording and put the phone on the desk. She still would not help me unless she took my cell phone and put it on the other side of the desk or gave it to the police officers.** After several exchanges, Ting eventually confiscated my personal property and put it on the far end of the desk out of fear of being recorded.\n\nShe rebooked me on flight AA2222 at around 8pm to DCA with no explanation. When I had asked her why I had a seat number to the flight I attempted to board, she said that the flight had already passed. She also attempted to hide any evidence that this occurred by taking away my printed ticket. Prior to this, **I had taken a photo of the printed ticket**, which I have included. **I have also included the boarding passes that she had rebooked me on.**\n\nI am shocked, disgusted, and traumatized by the behavior of both American Airlines managers and gate agents. Not only was I issued an invalid ticket, American Airlines employees attempted to threaten me, physically harm me, take away my personal property, and cover up the evidence of what had happened. I am having trouble sleeping and feel scared and anxious when I think of what had happened to me at DFW airport. These actions come after my flight from ABQ to DFW had a mechanical error and I had to stay the night at DFW. That flight number was AA2463 on April 27, 2019. The invalid ticket was issued to me when that flight landed at the Customer Service desk, using the computer at the far left of the counter. I also have witnesses who were on the same flight (AA2463) who can confirm that I had received a printed ticket with a seat number from a customer service representative for flight AA2483. In addition to possible security footage, I have credit card statements of a food item that I purchased at the 7-11 right across from gate C12 at Dallas Fort Worth before boarding time, showing that I was in the area on time for the flight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.

    "Last year I flipped my car driving on a highway in rural Texas (Baylor county). No other drivers were involved. This part of the highway was a slight curve. It had been raining but it stopped, and I was going the legal speed limit. There was no signage to indicate that this particular stretch of road was any more dangerous than any other. When the officer came to the scene he told me that he was already headed to this location anyways because every time it rains someone has an accident there. \n\nHe later ticketed me for a few hundred bucks because he said that going the legal speed limit, in those conditions was unsafe and I should have known that. I did not contest this at the time as I was in shock, and then later because I live far away and it was easier to pay it, and while it\u2019s a moot point now, I would like to know for my own personal sanity wether I could have contested it, and how valid a ticket for going the legal speed limit is, especially when that stretch of road is known locally to be dangerous?",

Their insurance company is not a big name brand, based out of Maryland, and has been extremely slow and less than helpful. It took WEEKS for them to even get the car from the lot it was towed to. I cancelled my insurance around this time since it was clearly totaled and I was waiting to transfer them once I got a new car. They officially notified me it was totaled. So, they sent me papers for the car and I mailed it back. They delayed sending the checks (for the car and mailbox) then sent them to my old address on my license instead of the address they used to send the paperwork. I finally got the car check, not the mailbox yet. Haven't cashed it yet, but now I get a fine from the MVA.

I tell him this is not the time for this conversation, and I am there to bury our father.  Later that night while at the wake, the family learns that my brother and my fathers cousin had gotten my father to set up a trust and they had kept this trust a secret.  My brother starts telling people how he now has control of everything.  We learn that some how he got my father to put a life estate in the will for my brother (who has never worked a day in his life) to live at my fathers house till he dies and that my brother also somehow got my father to put his name on the deed of my father other house with full rights of survivorship. My brother also tell us that dad had $374k and that he had moved $300k into the trust.  The rest is gone.\n\nMy father had a long time girlfriend, she has possession of some of his bank statements.  My brother got his name put on most of my fathers accounts as well.  In Massachusetts we have found that \u201coperation of law\u201d means my brother gets everything in those accounts since his name is on them.\n\nNow back up a bit.  My father was very religious.  About 6 years ago while at church has was getting friendly with some younger people, like early 40\u2019s.  These people started scamming money out of him.  He thought he was helping them but they were buying drugs.  They got a lot of money out of him by the time I found out.  I fly up there and take my father to his banks and we discuss things with the bank reps and I find out at one of the banks that they have been helping him write checks to American express and that he has a $29,000 bill that these scammers racked up by buying gift cards at all the local stores.  All that in 1 month.  The bank is helping my father pay for things he did not purchase!  I immediately get on Amex\u2019s case and after several months I get them to wipe the charges and refund the $4000 he had paid them.  Elder services gets involved as well to look at what had been done to my father.  But they would not share any info with us, other than my father may no longer be competent.   At this point I seem to get things to be heading on the right track for him.  My brother states that he will keep an eye on things.\n\nMy brother then finds an attorney in our home town.  He and the attorney get some Dr. to declare my father is competent.  Then they remove my sister as my fathers healthcare proxy, she has been a nurse for 40 years.  Then without our knowledge my father signs over his house to my brother and the trust is created and kept secret.  My brother and my fathers cousin are named trustees.  Then my brother moves a large sum of my fathers money into the trust.  This was 1 year ago.  Now with these bank statement we can see my brother withdrawing large amounts of money from my fathers accounts.  $21,000 in one month.\n\nI have people pushing me to file in probate to confirm the will, but I am afraid to do so without the right type of lawyer.\n\nTL;DR\n\nFather passed away, brother with the help of a lawyer and local bank employees has stolen all my fathers assets so that the will has no control.",

    "My boyfriend and I are supposed to move into a new apartment in a few weeks. \nWe left a security deposit way back in February and signed a lease shortly after. A few days ago, we changed the date we were supposed to move in, and the leasing agent drew up a new lease with this new date and sent it to us to be signed again.  We have not yet signed this new lease. \n\nBefore we received this new lease, I had applied for renters insurance as required by the new apartments management. The zip code on my insurance paperwork and the zip code on the lease are different. They are off by one number. The insurance paperwork auto filled in my zip code based on the address I input, so I\u2019m not sure which zip code is wrong. Because of this, we have not signed the lease. I have tried to contact the leasing agent to verify which zip code is correct multiple times, and she has not responded. I have called the management company, and they forward me to the leasing agent, who does not answer my calls or respond to my messages. \n\nDue to this lack of communication my boyfriend and I want to find a different apartment. However, I am concerned about where my rights lie; we DID sign a lease at one point. Is this lease void because our agent drew up a new one, and therefore we are free to back out without repercussion? If we ARE free to back out, will we lose our security deposit? Or are we bound by the first lease and can therefore be on the hook for rent for the months originally stated?\n\nThank you in advance. I\u2019m very confused and concerned. I don\u2019t have much experience with renting apartments on my own like this.",

    "I'm a registered dietitian, running a website that offers free nutritional information and recipes (ad-supported) and I offer a paid program that helps people with their diet. \n\nI received a cease and desist from an American dietitian who has a website with a very similar name as mine, and a US trademark for part of it. Both of our sites have names that include our personal names as well as the trademarked name, although my name is not in my URL, my URL is just the trademark in question. But because our personal names are all over both of our sites, I find it hard to believe my use of the trademarked name is likely to confuse anybody.\n\nThe letter states:\n\n> Your company has begun providing nutrition & wellness counseling under (trademark) a trademark that is identical to the trademark my company uses for nutrition & wellness counseling. On August 26, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued the decision that the Lanham Act may be enforceable in cases even where most of the defendant's infringing acts happen in Canada. The implications of the Ninth Circuit decision for Canadian businesses that adopt a trademark that is similar to a U.S. trademark are far reaching. \n\nIn that case a US resident was buying Trader Joe's products and selling them in Canada under the name \"Pirate Joe's.\" This seems vastly dissimilar from what I'm doing.\n\nI found this info on that case:\n\n> In the decision, the court noted the following when determining that the Lanham Act should apply to the defendant\u2019s infringing activities:\n\n>* Trader Joe\u2019s was granted Canadian trademarks1, and there is no ongoing proceeding relating thereto;\n* the defendant is subject to US law because he is a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the United States;\n* the defendant held assets in the United States and sourced the goods from the United States, and that the district court could enforce an injunction against the defendant\u2019s foreign conduct;\n* \u201cmore than forty percent of the credit card transactions at its [Trader Joe\u2019s] Bellingham, Washington store are with non-United States residents;\u201d and\n* the defendant knowingly pirated Trader Joe\u2019s\u2019 intellectual property and disguised himself to purchase from Trader Joe\u2019s to avoid being identified.\n\nNone of these apply to my case. \n\nThe nature of our two businesses are also fairly different. My business is primarily online whereas she appears to have more of a traditional local practice with an office and clients. I don't provide counselling in the region where she provides counselling, and as far as I know she doesn't provide counselling in my region. A dietitian can only provide counselling in the region in which they're registered.\n\nI do have revenue from the US in the form of advertising revenue and sales of my online program. But the program consists solely of mass emails and an online group chat forum that I participate in with all my clients, which is not considered counselling by my college of dietitians. I'm not clear on whether the legal definition of \"nutrition and wellness counseling\" would be different though, as it pertains to trademarks. Would mass emails, articles, and a group chat be considered nutrition and wellness counseling?\n\nIs this a letter something I need to take action on? I have a friend in Canada who received something similar years ago, and she ignored it, with no problems so far. I have considered re-branding myself under my personal name for other reasons, so I'm not 100% opposed to just abandoning this trademark, but that would be a lot of work and I would sacrifice some of my current presence on google, at least temporarily.\n\nThank you for your help!",

I have lived in many apartments before and have never encountered a situation like this. I asked if there was a manager I can go to for any issues regarding the apartment and they told me they don't have a rental manager and that they are renting out the apartment themselves so I'm not sure if they own the apartment or just the unit itself. Please educate me if there is such a thing as owning your own unit because to my knowledge I don't assume so. Anyways, they want to send me the key and any hard documents before I make any deposit or rent payments and that I am free to move in at my convenience but have to start paying rent and giving the deposit the first month I move in.  I asked if I could see the complex today or tomorrow before anything gets sent to me so hopefully that goes well.\n\nHow does this sound?

    "I live in a condominium in New Jersey and experienced heavy water damage as a fire sprinkler burst while I was out of town. Unfortunately, by the time the neighbors downstairs noticed, both my top and bottom floors were completely innundated. A full rebuild was essentially required, electrical, drywall, floors, tiles, etc..\n\nThe general contractor I went with is the \"go to\" contractor for the condominium where I live, so they do all the maintenance work and repairs across 200+ units and are responsible for a lot of work around there for several years. Their reputation seemed legit and the obvious choice to go with for my rebuild. \n\nInitially they did a great job with mitigation and selecting the rebuild materials early on was a good experience with no pushback from them - in fact they threw in some free upgrades because of the size of the job. By free upgrades I mean recessed lights, taking down a side wall to open the layout, and some attic work to better insulate and add storage space. My oversight was not having a contract with them as the insurance approved the contractor and I figured they would not do a poor job given their reputation with the condominium association.\n\nThe problems started at the rebuild where several details were disregarded and the workers either damaged my appliances and other personal belongings or simply did a poor job in the repairs. The floor is not level for example. The recessed lights are not aligned correctly. The bathroom tiles are not cut straight and look like a very amateur job. The walls have dings. The new hardwood floor has scratches from negligence walking around with nails on the floor and moving furniture by dragging it across the new floor.\n\nWe originally estimated the work to be done by first week of April and it's now first week of May with several items still pending. The house is not ready, not even enough to partially move in. I predict another month putting me out for a June move date. I have exhausted the insurance accommodation budget and am paying out of pocket for 2 weeks now, and possibly the whole month of May. \n\nSince I don't have a contract, it's hard to know what I can do or what the best course of action would be to make this right. The contractor when confronted with quality issues agrees to fix but then I find more problems were generated, putting us out more time to then revisit and fix properly. I go to the house every morning and evening to check in on the progress and see very little of it - a lot of needed rework is what I typically see.\n\nThis is a very long post, so thank you for reading, please let me know if you have any experience helping out clients in my situation as far as what legal action is advised if any.",

    "I don't know if this is going to sound stupid to you folks that know more about the law than I do, but I'm just trying to make sure there's nothing I can do before I do nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast weekend I went on an overnight trip, driving about two hours away. On the way, I came across a section of highway that was incredibly poorly maintained, but there were no warnings about this whatsoever. I had no way of knowing when I went to pass a slow moving truck pulling a trailer (two lane, so passing legally in the oncoming lane) that when I would have to move back over I would be greeted with an eight inch wide pothole that stretched out a few hundred feet that separated the two lanes. With oncoming traffic fast approaching I had no choice but to suck it up and cross the ravine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI made it over, but it damaged my tire's sidewall such that I need a new one, and this is going to require that I order one from out of state and will likely take me near a week to get my car back to full working order. The more expensive part is the chip in the wheel. It may be shallow enough to repaint, or I may just have to buy a whole new wheel, at this point it's unclear. The wheel is between $150-$200, repairing the rim would likely be a couple hundred, $500ish to replace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf this had happened a month ago I might not have cared as much, I would have been driving an old truck I bought for $500 and it needed new tires anyways. But last weekend I was driving my two week old car, less than 600 miles on the odometer. This is literally a brand new tire and wheel that I'm looking at replacing, all because the road has been neglected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn my way back through this area (on my spare) I noticed that for several miles the two lanes are separated by dozens and dozens of such potholes. These are large enough that someone trying to cross them in a motorcycle would certainly crash, and most vehicles (barring jacked up offroaders) would likely suffer the same damage I did. My theory is that as they are in the process of converting the highway to 4 lanes (2 in each direction) they've decided to not repair the road after winter because they will be tearing it up and replacing soon anyways. The problem with that is the road is still in a terrible state right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, to my question; Is there any chance I could get compensated for the tire and damage to my wheel? What about the fact that I can't realistically use my vehicle as intended (speed limit on spare) for a week?

I merged into the oncoming lane across smooth pavement, then back over a chasm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Road had hazardous conditions without any sort of warning, now I need to replace the tire and possibly the wheel on my brand new car, can I get compensated for this?",

Got into a jeated dispute where the cops came...twice. they kept yelling me  from the back door and cops had to come back out. \n\nAnyways. Later that night I got two text. One from my brother and one from a friend. This lady posted my address online and claimed I was crazy. I again called non emergency, and about 15 minutes later I get a call from a deputy and says (for lack of better terms) I'm shit out of luck and they can get my adress from white pages.

    "I currently work at an event company in Nevada and have been for about 6 months now. We will call this Clown Corp. I do a variety of things including face painting, balloon twisting, decorations etc. for kids parties and company Picnics. I am NOT on a 1099, I'm on a W-2.\n\nSince I started this job, my employer has been fairly dogdy with regard to telling her employees what their hourly rate will be for different jobs. She is often caught giving different employees different rates for the same jobs, or not telling them at all. When asked what the rates will be, she gives unclear answers. For example, I was asked to pick up supplies from another gig and bring them back to our supply warehouse. Of course I said yes, and when I asked what I would be paid for this gig (it only took me 30 minutes to gather the supplies, and 20 minutes of driving one way) she said \"just use your best judgment.\" When I asked a coworker what they were paid for the same exact gig, they said they were told it was a flat rate of $25. It seems to be a recurring issue and honestly, I don't care what she pays me, I just want her to remain consistent with what she's paying people.\n\nNow we get to the worst part. I collectively work between 40-60 per week at this one job, doing a variety of different things to meet full time hours. I even started working in the office to pick up extra time. I'm driving all over town, running errands, assisting others with their gigs, and making decent money. When someone asked me if I got overtime pay, I said no. I hadn't even thought about it before it was mentioned, but I remember being paid time and a half for working overtime at my old job. Almost all of my coworkers work 40 hours or more per week, and it's common for us to have 12, 13, 14 hour work days. I had three last week. None of my coworkers have any background in business law so they had no idea they were even allowed to get overtime. I'm considering bringing it up with my employer and seeing if she even knows about the overtime laws or if she is just hoping we don't know about it. If this is the case, I'm owed close to a few thousand dollars for all of the overtime pay I have missed since becoming an employee here.\n\nI am  unsure of what my next step should be, or if I am missing some parts of the law that would prevent me from getting paid this overtime. I do know that all of our employees are overworked and tired, we put up with the hard work because many of us need the pay and we like what we do. It's just the long hours that are getting to us. Now even more so knowing that we might not be getting the pay we deserve.\n\nI would really appreciate some advice..Thank you in advance!", 
    "Me and my girlfriend received a text saying that our bus had been cancelled minutes before our bus was supposed to depart from Rotterdam to London. This of course meant that we had to book another ticket and a place to stay overnight.   Since we don't have very much money, we called FlixBus and the guy on the phone **swore** that we would be reimbursed for both the new ticket and the hotel. We made sure to take his name, he promised that the conversation had been recorded, and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward a week and we find that they have given us the money for the return ticket but not the hotel. When we wrote to them asking about this they replied saying \"In case of such cancellations, you can indeed use hotel services and FlixBus will refund you the hotel cost up to 80 Euros. In case the hotel costs over 80 Euro, that does not mean we will not refund you anything. That simply means that you will receive the maximum amount of refund, e.g. 80 Euros **if you will continue the journey the day after\u00a0with us and not booking another alternative transport. Therefore, since your ticket price has been refunded we regret that we cannot meet your request in this case for the Hotel costs.\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that the guy on the phone **told us** to book with Eurolines, not FlixBus, since FlixBus didn't have available space on any buses the next day.

    "Hi I would really like some advice on the best way to respond to this situation.\n\nThe background is that in mid February I decided that I wanted to move out of a home that I was a tenant in before my lease ends in August. I emailed my land lady and notified all my roommates to see if that was okay. They all agreed and we found a new sublet to amend the lease. Everyone was on board and I obtained both verbal and written agreement from everyone in the party that I could move out. I moved out on a Saturday of early April and the new tenants moved in the same day and all seemed okay. The following Monday, my landlady informed me that the last step was I needed to sign a lease amendment in which the new tenants already signed (to release me from the lease). She had not printed it yet but the new tenants and I signed. \n\nLater that same day in the evening, I received notification that a domestic violence problem erupted between the new tenants and that they wish to break the lease. The problem is that my roommates (who haven\u2019t signed the amendment yet) now decided not to sign it at all because of this new problem and they don\u2019t want the new tenants to have a right to live in the home. They are currently holding me legally responsible for the rent and are threatening to bring it to a small court if I don\u2019t agree to hold up with the rent. \n\nI believe this is unfair because I already received everyone\u2019s agreement for me to move out and I already did move out and received pay for my security deposit. This conflict happened AFTER the new tenants moved in. The only attachment is the amendment that my roommates refused to sign, after they agreed I could move out. \n\nShould I let them take the case to the small court, or is it better to oblige and just pay the rent? \n\nThank you", 
    "So I just was reading my local police blotter , and this sounds like illegal entry. I was just curious what legal advise had to say.  Obviously fighting a police offer after entry is just stupidity but there was no female so how couldn\u2019t entry be justified was it due to the made up moaning ? \n\nOn 04/27/19, Sgt. xxx along with Officers Xxx responded to Justin Court for a report of a neighbor hearing yelling and screaming coming from one of the apartments. Upon arrival, the officer\u2019s approached the front door of the residence and could hear yelling and screaming coming from inside the apartment. They also could hear moaning coming from what sounded like a female along with pounding/striking noises. They knocked on the door several times and announced their presence. A male, later identified as Mr. Tyler Xxx replied to go away and that no one was getting in his house without a warrant. He also stated that he would make anyone who entered his residence sorry for doing so. After several attempted to get the homeowner to open the door and continually hearing threats and constant moaning in pain and loud noises coming from inside the room, the officers forced the door open to check the well being of the occupants. Upon entering the residence, the officers were immediately attacked by Tyler. A scuffle ensued with Officers  wrestling Tyler to the ground in an attempt to arrest and handcuff him. During the scuffle Office xxx was struck in the head and face area by Tyler several times and Officer Xxx injured his wrist. Once Tyler was handcuffed he continued to be combative, his brother, Damian Xxx was present and became combative and disorderly and was arrested and handcuffed as well. While escorting Tyler out of the house he remained combative and grabbed Officer Xxx handgun in an attempt to remove it. Tyler was eventually subdued and was removed from the residence and was transported, along with his brother, to police HQ for processing. Both Tyler and Damian were charged with Resisting arrest, Possession of CDS, Terroristic threats and Disorderly conduct. Tyler was also charged with Aggravated assault on a police officer, Disarming a law enforcement officer and simple assault. Damian was additionally charged with obstruction and Criminal mischief.

    "Hi reddit, \n\nHoping we may be able to do something here. The woman lived in my Grandmothers neighborhood and many have commented that she was part of my very sweet Grandmas \"open door policy\", she is known to have some sort of mental issues of some kind but it seems she has a weird obsession with my Grandma/family. I'll call her Q for sake of this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Grandma got very sick suddenly, went from fine at Thanksgiving to bedridden by January with an aggressive cancer that had already spread. From diagnosis to death was about 3-4 weeks. While my Grandma was still in the hospital I began receiving many messages on Facebook from Q, claiming to be my Grandmas best friend and needing to see her. I gave her the hospital and room information to visit my Grandma. While at the hospital she told many stories that people were scratching their head at, as many could tell they were not true and did not even make sense. Claiming she taught my Dad to drive, and was at the birth of my Aunt, and more, which many parties have refuted as false and we privately discussed the stories of the woman and agreed she is very odd but we have all still been nice to her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the day of the funeral, she shows up with these photo albums. 3 of them, filled to the brim of \\*literally precious\\* family photos that many of my Grandmothers kids hadn't even seen. Photos of them under the Christmas tree, photos of my Grandmothers relatives, photos of when my Grandmas first husband was still alive (Q wouldn't have even lived near my Grandma at this time), and just SO many photos and memories that there's literally no possible way she was part of these photos. When she busts out these photos everyone was in shock, and just enjoying the photos and passing them around, but she began to get very defensive when we started asking some questions. I showed my Aunt some of the photos of her father (my Grandmas first husband) and then very nicely went up to Q to ask if it was possible that my Aunt kept 1 photo of her own father. Q got a nasty look on her face and proclaimed they are HER photos. This went on the entire memorial when someone found precious photos and would ask her about them. The family was not happy about this to say the least, but we were also mourning my Grandmother and didn't want to engage this obviously crazed woman. After talking it over with Q, she promised the family to have digital copies of the photos made (since they are HER photos according to her!) seriously f this lady......\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's now almost May. She has been saying she's getting the digital copies made but excuse after excuse keeps coming up. We've offered to have her drop the photos off somewhere they can scan them for us and return the albums to her, we've offered to scan them ourselves, we've played nice and wished her well and \"looking forward to seeing the photos\" so many times. Something is very off with this woman obviously, and as much as we would love our original copies of the photos she stole at this point we are lucky if she provides us the digital copies. Do we have any recourse here whatsoever? I'm at my wits end and at the end of the day they are just photos, but they are precious family memories of my Grandma and the entire family and I'm so sick of playing nice with this woman only for her to keep throwing excuses at us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo we have \\*any\\* legal recourse here? I'm willing to keep going to get those photos and at this point if there's any way for us to get the original copies that'd be the best possible outcome, but we will settle for just the digital ones as well. She absolutely, 100%, stole these photos. Should we just give up here?",

    "On Thursday of last week, a driver ran a red light and t-boned me, sending my car flipping twice and sliding on it's roof.  My car is completely totaled, and the police report shows the other driver as being at fault.  I promptly reported the accident to the other driver's insurance \\[allstate\\] after the accident, and was told that a rental car would be approved by the claims adjuster.

Here is on Monday, 4 days after the accident and they still not have approved my rental.  I am trying to avoid bringing my insurance into this situation at all, since it was at no fault of my own.

    "Throwaway. I will add additional details if needed. This is in Southern California. \n\nBackground:\nI worked in an office since 2017. For reasons I\u2019d rather not go into unless relevant, things took a bad turn. The options were get fired or resign. I resigned, packed up, handed over my key, and let them know I would return to hand over my building access key card as I didn\u2019t have it on me at the time. It seemed as fine as it could be given the situation - I thought I took it well, I didn\u2019t get defensive or yell, I was apologetic and I took responsibility for my actions.\n\nI emailed the office manager to say that I might be out of town today but, if that was the case, I would return the key card when I returned. I also inquired about my final paycheck. She responded by telling me to drop the card in the mail and that my paycheck will be paid to me the day after the card is received. \n\nI find this a little irritating and problematic. I didn\u2019t end up going out of state so I would have been fully capable of going in person to deliver the card but now I feel like doing so would seem like defiance. \n\nFrom researching employment laws in the past, I was under the impression that an employer had to pay out an employee who resigns within 72 hours. Is this just standard three days or is it three business days?\n\nNow I\u2019m worried about receiving my final paycheck at all and if my time will be updated and my PTO cashed out. \n\n\nQuestion:\nAre they allowed to withhold my pay until I return the key card? Let it be said that I had every intention to return it and never insinuated otherwise.\nIn paying final paychecks, is it due within 72 hours or 72 business hours?\nBy law, is my sick time and vacation hours payable to me?\nWhat can I do?",

    "For context, this is the first car accident of any kind I have been involved in and I am pretty inexperienced here.\n\nSo around 9 last night while driving in Baltimore City I was stopped at a red light at an intersection when suddenly I hear a screech and get hit from behind by a car that, from the amount of force I felt, must have been breaking. I looked back, the driver and I locked eyes. From the angle her car was at it looked like she had been trying to swerve away but hit the back right corner of my car. I flick on my blinkers and open the door to go back and talk to her. She sees me get out and immediately reverses and peels through the red light out the intersection and off down the road. As she goes off I see that her front left corner is pretty well smashed in and is partially detached and dangling. All this happens in about 30 seconds, no hope of me following her.\n\n I could see that the car was a modernish looking blue/grey compactish sedan (like a Corrolla or Civic or Cruze or something like that), and the driver was a heavyset middle aged white woman. But I didn't get any plate or model of the car or anything like that. A man who had been standing at the median came up to me and said he saw that the car had been swerving around kinda erratically before it hit me, but couldn't give me much more than that. I didn't think to get any of his contact info at the time unfortunately, but considering the street I was on is a pretty common place for people to stand at the median and panhandle at the red lights and the Baltimore Police harass the people there pretty frequently, I'm not sure he would have wanted to give me contact info or act as a witness for me anyway.\n\nSo I pull off the road into a parking lot and go back to check how bad my car is. To my surprise there is no visible damage of any kind to my car aside from a small white scuff on the bumper about 2 inches square. For context, while the car who hit me was a modern sedan, my car is a 2000 Jeep Cherokee that is built for offroading, whose back bumper is at the same height as the sedan's grill, probably had between 500 and 1000 pounds on the compact sedan, and which probably predates a lot of crumple zone design philosophy. So I'm honestly not that surprised my car got way less banged up than the one who hit me, but never expected it to be that lucky.\n\n Just to be safe I took tons of pictures of the back, both sides, bumper, wheel wells, and undercarriage, and send them to my dad ( I live on my own and have the car insured under my name, but it is still titled under my parents) who says he also sees no damage besides the scuff on the bumper. I test the tail lights, turn signals, open, close, lock and unlock the rear door, check over the gas cap, look for dripping fluid and smell for gas, all that, and find no other issues. My dad said that this was probably not worth calling police or insurance about, and to maybe just drive it around a little more the next day to make sure it feels normal (plan to do this today after work; I walk to work so haven't driven since last night) and if something seems off get it put up on a lift and checked sometime this week. I was only about five minutes from home so I decide to head back, car seems to be driving totally normal. So at the time I figured yeah, maybe not worth getting anyone involved if the sum damage is a tiny little scuff on 20 year old bumper.\n\nNow the next day I am wondering if this was the right choice.\n\nSo I just wanted to get people's read on this. Is this something I should contact either my insurance or the cops or both about? As I said there seems to be no real damage to the car and I am worried about driving up my premium or getting some kind of strike with insurance or something like that or what filing a police report would do with my driving record or whatever. And while I can give the police a rough description of the car, driver, time to within about 10 mins, and the exact intersection (all of which can probably give them enough to find it on traffic camera footage if there was one there), at this point I am not sure if it would be useful for much more than punishing the driver, since my car seems ok. And I'm not sure how either cops or insurance are gonna take me not calling them last night.\n\nI apologize if this is an obvious thing I should know but as I said I have never been involved in an accident before.\n\nAnd sorry if the post is way more detail than is needed, not very familiar with the practices of this sub either. Thanks for the help!",

    "I live in the hood. Last Friday I was washing my car in my apartment's underground parking structure. Another tenant wanted to get out and angrily told me to move my car.

    "Disclaimer: Sorry my english and grammar isn't the greatest\n\nI'm expecting a small sum of non-taxed money in the sum of 15-20k dollars from a settlement. I have obtained some debts since I was 18 that I'd like to pay off before I do anything else as they're holding my credit back.  A 5k charged off car repossession from a co-signed loan I got burned on, I spoke to the collection agency who purchased the debt who said they'd settle for 2500 but can only write it off as a paid charge off, I also have a 3k medical debt that I can settle for 1500 and a few misc medical bills that'll total out to about 3-4k. So after all is said and done I'm expecting at-least 12k left over, best case.\n\n I'm expecting a child in a few months and I'd like to have at minimum of 5k as my 2-3 months of living expenses tucked away because I have absolutely no savings and I'm not expecting any major influx of money ever again which will leave me with 6 to 7k left. I'd like to invest that remaining money so that It doesn't just get burned through wastefully spending. I at first wanted to start purchasing vehicles and repairing them as I have some mechanical aptitude, a generous collection of tools but lack a truck and trailer for hauling them and would need a little more equipment. I also considered investing in a more reliable vehicle and using the remainder to invest in college as I'm only a high school graduate (yet I'm 23 so the learning curve it going to be steep as I want to go into engineering at a community college level). \n\nI don't want my current source of income to be my only income because it barely covers my expenses as is and with a child on the way I know they're going to increase. The \"flipping\" of vehicles will give me immediate cash but won't be steady. College would be long term but I need short term income and I'm to ignorant when it comes to investment funds or things similar to trust myself with it on wall street or any other forms of investment.

    "Post title says it all. I have been working my butt off for the past 3-4 years and I have saved ~$150,000! I am super proud but I haven't really been investing to much outside of my 401k. I don't have much in the way of family or friends to ask for advice here. I have been teaching myself about finance & investing- which I was illiterate in up until the past year or so. I want to start seriously investing- but because this is my first time I don't want to loose my money on stupid stuff or technical details.

    "I am starting grad school in the fall at a US university. I need to make a budget. My expenses until now have for the most part been covered by family, and I have been saving the vast majority of money I have made. Any expenses I pay for are usually voluntary.\n\nI am therefore having lots of trouble coming up with realistic amounts I will likely spend in many budget categories. Without such numbers, I cannot figure out what rent I should be shopping for. Without a rent $/month amount, I can't figure out how much I should be spending in the other categories. A chicken and egg problem presents itself. I need help ensuring I am not going to exceed my monthly budget.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLIVING SITUATION:\n\nI am single with no children or pets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDEBTS: \n\nNone yet (and I want to keep it that way). I pay my credit card off in full each month. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINCOME:\n\nI will be earning $21,400 / year. This is the quoted amount, and I understand this to be tax exempt. Thus, I am earning 1783.33 $/month that I have to budget.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEXPENSES:\n\nThis is where I need help. Where I am going to school, rent is cheap. I am looking at apartments in the $500-$900/month range. However, I am trying to create a more complete budget projection so that I know where exactly in that range I can afford. Multiple entries in a typical budget are hard for me to pin down. By going through the prime directive flow chart, I've identified all the categories below. Here is my best estimates thus far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rent**\n\nThis is the category I am trying to pin down. What is the total amount that I can afford to pay for the roof over my head? I am going to lump in all utilities ( electricity/water/internet/etc... ) into this category since each place I'm looking at has a different arrangement. This way, I can say, in total, I can't spend more than X for the roof and its utilities in total.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe advice here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting) suggests that I shouldn't be paying more than $1783.33/month \\* 0.3 = $535.00/month on rent. Given that I've been told that the rent where I'm moving to is really cheap, and my income is not that much lower than that of other graduate students I've talked to and offers that I was made, this amount seems really low. Maybe this guidance is for people earning 1.5-2 times as much as me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Communications**\n\nI am lumping in internet with rent, and I am not yet assuming my own cell phone bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insurance**\n\nCar: I don't yet know what car I will have, so I can't so much as get a quote. It will be new and I have no prior accidents, crashes, or other events on my record yet.\n\nHome: I don't know if I need this with renting or if I need or should get this at all. Advice?\n\nHealth: I am getting insurance through my university. I am apparently responsible for 20% of the premium, but I have not been quoted what the premium is. My contract with the university quotes a $529.00 number as being 20% of the premium, but it also suggests that is per month, which would be 1/3-1/2 my budget. So I don't think I understand this part correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Food**\n\nMy data over the past 6 months says:\n\nDaily Minimum: $23.35\n\nDaily Avg: $25.15\n\nDaily Maximum: $27.48\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProjected out these values give:\n\nMonthly Minimum: $723.85\n\nMonthly Avg: $779.53\n\nMonthly Maximum: $851.88\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe budgeting advice here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting) says $300/person/month is an upper limit on what should be considered normal. The data I used is for dining hall spending (I'm not currently cooking for myself). I plan to start doing so. I understand this should allow me to cut food costs dramatically, but getting down to $300 seems low. I have had the rule of thumb about US cost/meal that a full meal typically costs $10 or less in the US. $300/month is about $10/day (1/3 my rule of thumb). Is this really achievable if I cook for myself? I don't have a good grasp on how much cheaper bulk groceries are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Transportation**\n\nI will have a car and will be commuting everyday. This is not avoidable by public transport or walking.\n\nFuel: An upper bound calculation for distance/day, mi/gallon (underestimated), price/gallon, and days/year I have devised is (25 mi/day) \\* (365 days/year) / (20 mi/gallon) \\* ($3.00/gallon) = 1368.75 $/year or $114.06/month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaintenance: I do not have a good grasp of how much scheduled maintenance on a car is. This is one entry I need help on. I plan to pay for unscheduled maintenance costs from a short term savings allocation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Household Supplies**\n\nI have very little grasp on what a monthly dollar amount would be for this. I imagine there are a lot of these supplies that I would buy once and would have on hand for years before needing to replace/restock (bed sheets). Others might need weekly replenishing (paper towels). Guidance?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Education Fees**\n\nThey are charged 3 times / year, and average out to $180 / month  \n \n\n**School Supplies**\n\nThese are typically front loaded at the beginning of each semester, which makes it hard to budget. Textbooks are by far the largest portion of these expenses. A worst case scenario is that I need to buy 2-3 new textbooks each semester ($100-$200 apiece). I could buy used, but would strongly prefer not to. I am a student who values and uses my textbooks a lot. My remaining expenses would be for paper, notebooks, writing implements, etc. probably $40/semester or $100/year. Those are very rough numbers, and probably close to an upper bound.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Technology Subscriptions**\n\nI currently am subscribed to a number of technology subscription services. In total, they amount to $37.76/month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Savings**\n\nSince I am in grad school, I am under no delusions, that the income I make while I am a student is going to be meager, and saving will be difficult. What % should I shoot for?  I plan to have a short and long term fund. I will feed the short term one first until it equals 1-3 month's expenses, then fund the long term one. Is there a better way to do this / think about this allocation both on a monthly basis and on an absolute amount basis?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Discretionary Spending**\n\nI want this to be non-zero, but calculated as DS = income - (all expenses including savings). $50/month would be a goal I want to meet at a minimum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:\n\n1. How should I think about and budget for very infrequent expenses (purchase of durable goods for example)? \n2. I have outlined many expenses here, but expenses come in all shapes and sizes. Any I haven't thought about here that I should be planning for?", 
    "Hi all! I am 25 and have a great job, last year I made 78k and my husband makes more than I do. We are renting ($1500 a month) and want to buy a house in the next 3 years.

    "Hi all - long time lurker, first time poster. I have a question about 401k fund selection. I looked at the guide and reviewed my fund options, but I would be curious to know the opinion of the collective wisdom of this group:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, I (31M) have three retirement plans. Two from my former employer - a 403(b) and a pension - and one from my current employer, a 401k. In the 403(b) I have 13,185.55, in the pension plan I have $8,709.606, and in my current employer's 401k I have 6,673.17. I understand I'm very far behind on contributions to my retirement, but I think that's a post for another day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my current employer's 401k, I've 100% invested in a target date fund (American Funds 2050 Target Date Retirement Fund - Class R3) with a high net expense ratio of 1.07.

    " \n\nHello\n\nI'm a psychological therapist with a master degree and able to give therapy since last year, but I have a few years of previous experience.\n\nI started working for a private company with a fixed time contract that would give me a fixed monthly salary and a bonus depending on how many patients I see, at first it seemed adequate but the practice grew quickly and it did not reflect on my salary.\n\nI started charging $100 (USD) per session with a salary of $2,000 monthly and every four months a bonus of $30 for each charged hour after 200\u3001this would amount to approximately 40%, which I thought would be fine.\n\nBut after a few months of success the company changed my fees up to $150 per session, after being almost completely booked and really busy I ended up perceiving a smaller percentage of the price I'm charging, turning into merely 20%.\n\nAs I was in a contract for a year, and the company was really beneficial to me I decided to hold on and work the contract for a better pay with the renewal of contract.\n\nNow I have the opportunity to renegotiate my contract, but I don't know what percentage should I keep.\n\nNot only do I do therapy but I do everything from the first contract with the client, receiving them, organizing everything in the office, give the actual therapy until charging and scheduling future procedures as we don't have a receptionist neither we're planning on getting one.\n\nI am already booked for at least a month and more people are coming to me, how can I approach this situation with my employer and what would be the acceptable percentage for me to obtain? are there any guidelines or literature of the subject I could look through and present to my boss? Also should I push for removing the 200 hours of work previous to the bonus?",

But with on-time payments and responsible use, your score may actually increase over time.\n\nBut in my case I'd like to see as much improvement as possible by about October. Would the best course of action here be to pay off the two car loans by then? Or would I expect to see it mostly return to the higher score in that time?

    "My mother\u2019s sister died a month ago and yesterday I learned that I have been made co-executor of the estate and have inherited nearly 2 million dollars. Most of the inheritance is in IRAs. I believe they are traditional IRAs, not Roth. There is also a life insurance policy that should cover the estate taxes, and some smaller policies and cash from her bank account. My younger sister and I will both inherit my aunt\u2019s house, which for now we would like to keep.\n\nI already know that the IRAs should be put into a new inherited ira account. I am thinking of going with Charles Schwab or something like that. What I am not sure is what KIND of account should it be?  Mutual funds? Annuities?  I really don't know anything about finances. The IRAs make up about 1.3 m of the estate, so it is a pretty substantial part.  The rest I am thinking we will want in some sort of liquid, low yield account until we get our bearings.\n\nMy husband and I are pretty frugal. We have been married for 25+ years, have almost no retirement savings for ourselves, but are debt free and are sending our kids through college with no student debt at all.  (State school, paying cash.). We were set to pay off our home's mortgage this year, even without the inheritance.\n\nWith the inherited IRAs, we will have to take disbursements.  Should we start putting some into IRAs for ourselves? If we do the standard inherited IRA disbursements, the funds will dry up by the time we are about 85. We think we should have some additional funds set aside, right?\n\nAlso, if we decide to do some regular (non-IRA) investing, is a mutual fund a good idea?\n\nFinally, I am very ignorant about financial stuff. I have started reading some books, but I wonder if it is a good idea to hire someone, at least initially, who could help us navigate all this. There will be an estate lawyer, of course, and we have a CPA for my husband's small business. I don't necessarily want to pay a yearly fee for someone to babysit our accounts. We just want a good initial set-up while we figure out what we are doing. \n\nThanks for you help!\n\nPS: background- our income is middle of the road. Together, we gross about 90k.

    "Due to an accounting blunder on my part I owe about $7k in federal taxes this year. I filed through TurboTax and used their system to set up a payment plan. I thought that was all I needed to do, but I've been checking my bank statement and no funds have been withdrawn yet even though I set it up to pay $1k at time of filing, and $1k/mo after that. So I read through the tax docs and I figure I have to also set up the actual payments through [irs.gov/OPA](https://irs.gov/OPA)?\n\nI went ahead and did that, entered my account number and routing number and selected automatic bank account withdrawal, and the last page of the IRS site has all this language about making payments on time.

    "I'm sorry for the length, I wanted to give you guys all important information. \n\nI am a 20 year old college student. 7 days ago, I took out a **$9,900 car loan** with a local credit union for a **2014 Chevy Cruze with 60,000 miles** on it. My mom has 3 car loans under her name, my dad lost his job last year due to multiple sclerosis, and I have no family or family friends within 12 hours of me. I had absolutely no one to cosign for me. I've starting going through the process of building credit, but was sort of pressured into getting a car as soon as remotely possible by my parents. The only place that would give me the time of day was a local credit union, who told me that my interest rate would be \"*a little above*\" (their exact words) of their standard rate of 4%. I go to sign for the car, and the dealership's finance guy comes back and tells me that I was approved at an **18.25% interest rate for 4 years**. I should have stopped right there. I don't want to shift the blame away from me, this is my fault, but it was at this moment that my dad (who was advising me through this) told me that I should go ahead with it because it was the best deal I was going to get. I earn roughly **$1500/month after taxes**, don't pay rent, and have few mandatory expenses. I payed my parents $330 yesterday for 6 months' worth of insurance coverage. My monthly payment is $300 for 4 years, plus insurance. The problem is that I will have to stop working in 2.25 years when I go to graduate school, I have no choice in that aspect. I need to pay this off in less than 2 years. I deduced that I could pay my loan off entirely in less than 2 years by making $600 payments, however, I just found out yesterday that I may have to pay a sizable amount of tuition out of pocket. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*I have been toying with the idea of selling the car back to one of the 5 dealerships in town, and using my savings (\\~$2,000) and living frugally for a month or two to get rid of whatever remaining interest and fees there may be, working as much as possible and saving as much as possible over the summer, while building credit, and buying a reliable 2010ish Honda/Toyota with a better credit score before the next semester starts. I'll lose some money from the interest, but figured that my final loan amount will be less and hopefully my interest will be lower. That would also leave more of my income to be used for tuition.\n\nI don't know what the better option would be. I feel a little angry because I feel it was at least my parents' job to help me through this stuff but instead they made me feel that I needed to get something as soon as possible instead of continuing to share a car with my brother (which he was okay with, as the car was for both of us). Instead I feel like I was pressured into making an agreement that I didn't fully understand until the span of the previous week.\n\nGuys, what do I do? What is the best option to take here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Took out a car loan for $9,900 for 4 years at 18.25% interest. I am worried about affording it and other things. Am thinking about returning it, paying off remaining interest or fees, saving \\~$3,000 over the summer while building credit, and taking out a smaller loan for a still-reliable car at a smaller interest rate.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited: Formatting",

    "I just graduated and got a software engineering job in NYC. Preferably looking for studios or 1 br in lower Manhattan. \n\nI make $120k salary with a $35k signing bonus for the first year + $22k signing bonus for the second year, along with approximately $5k in RSUs vesting each year. The company provides an additional transportation stipend of $300/mo.\n\nAfter taxes and maxing out 401k, paying for insurance etc, I expect to take home around ~$6100 a month from the $10k base salary I am receiving each month.\n\nMy goal was to invest the entirety of the signing bonus into index funds and hold onto the RSUs, so I would like to think that all of my cash lies in my salary. \n\nI\u2019ve got around $10k in savings and the company is providing a fully assisted move, including a $2500 stipend, professional moving services, storage, up to $3k rent assistance, house hunting trip, etc. \n\nWith this in mind, is a $2500 rent budget irresponsible? \n\nI was thinking my budget would break down like this:\n\n-$2500 rent\n\n-$275 utilities\n\n-$700 groceries/food (ngl, I eat out quite a bit)\n\n-$500 entertainment/gym\n\nThis would put me at ~4k in spending, leaving for an additional ~2k of savings each month. Looking at some apartments in east village or LES that would fit what I\u2019m looking for in that budget.\n\nHowever, I could get a roommate or two and get the rent down to $1500 or so and still live in LES, giving me an extra $1000 in savings per month. I always have horrific luck with roommates, though, so I\u2019m pretty wary of sharing an nyc apartment with randos. \n\nFinally, I could just move to Brooklyn and save even more money, and possibly get rent down to $1000 a month if I had roommates. However, I feel that I should try out somewhere in lower Manhattan for my first year out of college, because that really seems like a once in a lifetime experience. I was thinking after my lease expires I could move out to Bushwick or somewhere similar that is a bit cheaper.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is biting the bullet on a 1 br in Manhattan fiscally irresponsible if it\u2019s possibly just for a year? Does my budget look reasonable and realistic for NYC?", 
    "I wanted to write a post to help those considering buying a car within the US from a long distance. I bought myself a used Miata in January of this year in Texas, and drove it home to NJ. I did so without having physically inspected the car prior to buying it. There are a couple reasons you might be interested in doing so:\n\n1. You can find a deal. I paid $21k (title/ tax not included) for a 2017 Miata with 11k miles on it.\n2. If you're looking for a used car with specific features (exterior/interior colors, trim levels) then opening up the search radius will help quite a bit.\n\nIt may seem a bit odd, but I would 100% buy a car like this again. I spent maybe 45 minutes in the dealership, and everything had been negotiated prior to me stepping in the door. It was cheaper than an equivalent car in my area, and I had a fun road trip out of it. So what's the process? Note that this only applies to buying from a dealership- long distance buying from private party is another animal altogether.\n\n1. Figure out what car you want, and how far you're willing to drive it home. How are you going to pay for it? Finance? Cash up front?\n2. Use a search engine like autotrader or cargurus to find cars that you want. I wound up liking car gurus the best, as their filters seemed to be the most accurate and specific.\n3. Once you've found the car you want, you'll need to call the dealership. Just say that you were browsing online and that you're interested in buying a car they have listed. Don't play it coy about you buying long distance, be upfront about it. They'll likely ask for a moment to confirm they have it in their inventory, and ask to call you back in a couple minutes. Ask them to send along the carfax.\n4. If they confirm it's available, reiterate that you're interested in the car, and that you'd like to schedule a third party inspection from the local area to come check out the car. Car inspectors are readily available in most cities, and my inspection in Texas cost about $115. I got a very detailed inspection report that covered everything from paint depth to driving feel. If they ask about a deposit, simply say that you need to have the inspection results prior to discussing purchase.\n5. After you get the inspection results, it's time to negotiate. This is still pretty similar to buying a car in person in that you negotiate each item based upon its total cash value, and one thing at a time. So first you discuss the price of the car, and just the car. Then move on to other items that may or not be applicable to you such as trade ins, financing terms, and warranties. Negotiate each item one at a time. The nice thing here is that you're not stuck in an uncomfortable dealership. \n5b. During this negotiation you'll need to also address any and all items that are going to be part of the sales contract. For me, this included documentation fees, registration fees and taxes. Regardless of where you purchase the car, you will only be paying taxes on it in your home state, where it will be registered. Do not pay sales tax to any other state. They will give you temporary registration tags, likely valid for 15/30 days. Make it clear to them that because you're buying the car from long distance, all costs need to be made apparent up front. In my case I flew in to Texas with a cashier's check already made out for the exact purchase price. (DO NOT LOSE A CASHIERS CHECK)\n6. Once you've agreed on purchase terms, they will ask for a deposit, likely around 1-3k. I'd recommend paying via credit card because it is easily documented and disputed. As part of this deposit, ask them to email you confirming everything that you'd negotiated above, that you're purchasing VIN #1234 for $X, and that the deposit comes off of the final purchase price of the car.\n7. You're pretty much done now! Now it's up to you to figure out how the car is getting to you. You can either A) pick it up yourself or B) have it delivered to you. A car delivery is 800-1500 depending on distance and car type. I picked my car up myself, so I can't comment much further on the delivery process, other than to ensure you go with someone who carries full insurance on the car you just purchased.\n7b. If you're picking it up yourself, then have fun! I flew into the airport, a dealership rep picked me up, I performed a final perfunctory inspection, we signed the documents, I hit the bathroom and then got on the road. The dealership actually took car of registering the car for me, but for the drive home I had temp tags. The plates and registration documents showed up via mail about a month later.\n\nOther tips: If you're driving it home: \n\n1: Check your route! Go have fun! We drove through Alabama and Mississippi, spent the night in NOLA, then swung north into North Carolina to visit UC Durham. And get off the highway! The interstates are boring. We randomly found a scenic route along the gulf coast in Mississippi and it was beautiful.\n2. Make sure you call your insurance company prior to picking it up, and get it added.\n3. Figure out the toll situation for the drive home. Do you need to bring a toll transponder? If not, do you need cash?\n4. Before you actually hit the road, figure out what you'll do in the event of a flat tire. I have AAA, but I still picked up a can of fix-a-flat because Miata's don't carry spare tires.\n\nHopefully this is helpful to someone!",

    "I've been trying to figure out what to do about this and I could really use some advice. I'm currently 25 and back in January of 2017 I was touring some apartments in a city that I thought I was going to stay in at the time. During this time I came across an apartment I really liked, it was a new complex with literally all college students, which is what I was at the time. During my tour the person working there said I should go to their website and \"fill out the application\" to try to reserve a certain unit. I went and did this and I remember just clicking through it and not paying a ton of attention to what I was doing, thinking it was all just a simple application. I came to a last page and remember doing an e-sign (I'd never heard of this before). I did it, just thinking it was the application.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple days later, due to unforeseen events I found out I'm not moving to this city all together. I call the person helping me telling them I didn't need that unit after all and to not worry about my application. She looks me up and says I apparently already signed a lease. I told her that can't be right and I race to their front office. I talked to the manager of the place and essentially told them it was a careless mistake and I'm no longer even moving to the city. She pretty much told me too bad and was really rude about it.

I\u2019m looking into opening a Roth IRA ASAP. I was considering going through TIAA, Fidelity or Vanguard.

Fidelity sent me through to their \u201cFidelity GO\u201d where they manage everything at a fee, Vanguard won\u2019t even do this unless I have 50,000 with them apparently and TIAA is the same as Fidelity however, I\u2019ve not heard much about TIAA as most people preach about Fidelity and vanguard. \n\nMy second area I\u2019m looking for advice on is CDs, what\u2019s the best route for this? Where do I start? I\u2019m vaguely familiar with them i.e. if I get a CD for 1k and pay it over a period of ex amount of time it raises my credit score and I get that 1k after the amount of time, correct?\n\nThirdly, I am looking to open an Ally savings account strictly for the interest rate, and throwing an emergency fund into that account and continually adding into it overtime. Seems like a pretty straight forward idea to me... \n\nFourth, currently I bank with Wells Fargo, have been since 2010 but I was looking into other options, I noticed chase has a 200$ bonus into a checking right now if you sign up with them and do direct deposits. Those of you with chase, how are your experiences with them? Is it worth leaving WF for essentially 200 free dollars even though I\u2019ve banked with them for 9 years? Does my time with Wells mean anything to them over someone that might only have been with them for a year?\n\nAnd lastly, what is the best option to invest my money in the short term? Index funds? Mutual funds?

    "Looking for some advice on a home purchase / potential offer.  We have been looking to purchase a new home for the last couple of years, but the market in our area is red hot and supply is quite low.  Our real estate agent made us aware of a property she is selling for a friend.  The home isn\u2019t listed on the market at this time but is available. \n\nThe home is exactly what we are looking for but has some issues when saw as we walked through it.  The house is around 8 years old and would be considered higher-end for our area.  My assumption is that the sellers decided to do some of the work themselves during construction, to save money, and have either never gotten to some items or did them in a manner that isn\u2019t consistent with he finishes in the rest of the house.  For example, interior painting is sloppy, base boards are not installed properly or are missing in some rooms, exterior doors don\u2019t close tightly, etc.  There are other issues with items in disrepair like a roof that has rust stains running down it on it from metal trim around the chimney and a deck that isn\u2019t finished and is showing wood rot.\n\nThese are just the things I see so undoubtedly a professional inspection would reveal much more.  We do have interest in the house as everything is what we are looking for, but it is also priced at a level that assumes most of this work is done.  Our agent suggests we make an offer contingent on an inspection, which would allow us to seek credits/remediation of these issues or get out of the deal altogether, however I struggle with what to even offer?  Would I offer a price based on the condition it sits today, knowing some of the work it needs, or do I make an offer more at the market price and use the inspection phase to reduce the price based on the findings?  I had offered to pay for an inspector to come in and view the house before we make an offer, but the seller wasn\u2019t interest in us putting that process ahead of a formal offer.  This house is at the higher end of our budget so I can\u2019t take the risk of paying too much for the house and then having repair work I need to fund as well.",

Paying off our student loans ($25k), which would leave us about $15k for a downpayment on a $210k house.\n2. Putting a full $40k down on the $210k house to minimize monthly amount, but continue grinding out the student loan payoff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStudent loan minimum is $222/month right now and we dump extra money at it.  The change in monthly mortgage payment from $40k down to $15k down would be around $150/month I believe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!", 
    "My wife and I are at a bit of a crossroads and could use some advice. We currently \"own\" a home and have lived there for several years. We bought it right before housing in our area hit a huge boom. Based on comparable house prices in our area, we stand to make ~$60k-$80k on the sale of our house if it sold at list price and depending on realtor fees, fixing things, etc. We've also been getting into the \"grass is greener\" mindset with renting. We rarely use our yard, we both dislike most yard work, and we've traveled a lot less since we bought a house  and quit renting. We're also not as into the DIY homeowner stuff as we thought when we first bought the house (or maybe we're burnt out). Basically all we've spent extra money on since we moved in is fixing things and remodeling. If we sold our house and got ~$60k, we would be out of debt and still have a lot in the bank. We could rent an apartment smaller than our house for about the same amount as our mortgage and live in a nicer area than we are currently in (more walkable, better neighborhood, closer to work, etc.). So, I'm looking for some general personal finance advice here. We know there are lots of personal, subjective reasons and preferences for owning vs. renting and we're considering our own reasons. But from a financial standpoint we'd like some insight from strangers. Would you do it? What are things to consider that we're not thinking of? Maybe some pros and cons of selling or staying? TIA!",

    "So I am the son of a mechanic of 35 years.  He's been able to keep up with the current technologies and has worked on some of the most basic and advanced vehicles in the modern era.\n\nIt pains me to see people say, \"buy a cheap reliable car\" as if that is something easy to do.  Unless you know a good mechanic that has access to dealer trades and auctions it can be tough.  Here in SW PA, cars over 150k miles are usually junk.  Rust due to salt, transmissions blown due to hills, etc.  Unless you live in the suburbs, cars are not garage kept.  My dad and I set out to find my grand mother a replacement car.  I gave her a 2005 grand prix in 2014 with no rust and in 4 years of being outside, the rockers cannot be patched anymore.\n\nWe looked at around 35 cars and unfortunately my dad is retired.  So he does not have access to dealer trades or auctions and most of his contacts have moved on or retired as well.  This is a compilation of what we saw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n35 vehicles total\n\n&#x200B;\n\n20 costing between 4-8k\n\n* 11 had rust beyond belief\n* 6 had check engine lights for multiple things (dad had a scan tool)\n* 3 had a fair bit cosmetic or mechanical issues (suspension or a ton of wear items)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n15 costing 8-12k\n\n* 6 had too much rust\n* 3 had check engine lights for multiple things \n* 3 had a fair bit cosmetic or mechanical issues\n* 2 were priced way over market value\n* 1 we found for just over 12k that we bought (was listed at 14k)\n\nWe looked at a wide range of cars. Sure about half were GM, but the rest were Subaru's, Toyota's and Honda's.  So this idea that people can \"easily\" find a \"cheap but reliable\" beater is a but insane.  Many of these cars would cost even us thousands to maintain for a year.  They could easily strand my grandmother as she travels to my uncles house every month (2 hour drive).  Her old 2006 grand prix started to have issues, water pump, suspension work and the rockers were shot, patched 3 times.\n\nNow I am not advocating for buying a new car.  But we ended up reaching out to my other uncles and they all put together money for a 3 year old chevy trax for her.  It has far more safety features than her old car, does much better in every crash test, should be reliable for 3-5 more years, etc.  We could have gotten her a sonic/cruze but she didn't feel comfortable in them (too low and small) and she's in her 80's so comfort is a thing.\n\nBut the moral to the story is, when offering \"advice\" you need to understand that a \"cheap but reliable\" car is not an easy find and if you live up north very difficult to do in many cases.  Don't assume that everyone has connections and has a reliable mechanic that can easily find good and cheap deals.  My dad found me that 05 grand prix that I drive for 5 years and it was about 8k when I bought it in 2009, but that was back when he had unlimited access to thousands of cars.",

    "Really glad I found this forum.  I've been stirring over this question a while.  I am 40 and a Federal employee (GS-15).  I have good credit (730's) and a VA Home loan available.  My debt consists of a car payment and the basics (no conventional loans or credit debt) and not much more.  My question is:  I took a TSP loan out a few years back after my divorce.  I am in the position now where I pay $500 a month towards it with it scheduled to be paid off in 3.5 years.  I am renting a one bedroom apartment for $1500, but can afford a place up to $2500 a month (MD is outrageously expensive).  My desire to move is because I have 2 daughters (11 and 14) and, again, the apartment is a 1 bedroom.  Since my new job a year ago I can now afford more home, so they can have their own rooms when they are over.  I have given myself two options:  The first, basically pay an extra $800 a month towards the loan and it is finished in 1.5 years wile contributing 3% towards TSP (for the matching), about the same time as the apartment lease is up, then get a place.  My girls will then be 13 and 16.  The second option, pay the loan as scheduled and get the place now.  Getting a place now means missing out on tsp contributions for a year and a half until my annual increases add up enough to do so, and continuing with the loan schedule of $500 a month for the next 3.5 years.  I'm trying to weigh that against my daughters and their ages and providing for them a better living environment when they are over.  Is a year and a half or so too long to miss out on  tsp contributions as well as the amount of the loan not being in the market (20k) if I am planning to retire in 20 years?  In about 3 years child support drops, then again in 6 years, child support will substantially drop (from the now 2k a month) and I'll be able to heavily contribute to my tsp, so I'm wondering how big of an impact the next couple years will have if I just go a head and upgrade my place.

I am unsure what to do with this money that will best benefit him and is NOT risky. If anyone has any ideas, please send them my way!\n\nThank you in advance to everyone!", 
    "I'm 18 years old and living with my parents somewhere in Europe (not saying for privacy). They are in big debts for probably another 40 years and I don't want to make that same mistake and ruin my future. I want to stay financially free and not owe anyone anything.\n\nIn about 2 years I will finish car-mechanic school and probably start working at a big repair shop which fixes luxury cars. Based on other mechanics in my country, I should get between 800-1000\u20ac for the first few years and then they could higher my salary to maybe 1400\u20ac/month (it could be higher if I show good results - 2000\u20ac ?). \n\nMy plan is to either quit this job when I get enough money for my repair shop and house (about 100.000\u20ac) OR continue working to earn even more and still have my repair shop at home (for fixing cars by myself).\n\nNow my question is is it good to take debt and have my house and repair shop as soon as I finish school or is it better to wait and not take debt (that would mean I would have to live with my parents for another 10 years or even more to be able to afford my own house). Another possibility is to work for a few years and save money so my debt will be lower.  \n\nIf I would take debt I would make sure to work hard and pay it off ASAP. I would like to hear your thoughts about this and what would you do if you were in my place.",

    "Hi I was wondering how you calculate your savings rate?\n\nDo you use your pre tax income? Or after tax?\n\nFor example if your monthly income is 2000 bruto (pre tax) and 1500 net (after tax) on which amount would you calculate it?", 
    "I know everyone has a different rule of thumb, and people's circumstances are all unique, etc.  But would love your best guess on what is a good amount for a home for us.\n\nAges:  Me 36 and him 38.  We potentially would like do a 15-year fixed mortgage but would also take a 30-year with wiggle room to pay off early as we don't want to be 65 years old with a mortgage payment.  We both work in NYC (me Manhattan, him varies but in the boroughs)\n\nIncome (both W-2):\n\n**Me:  $132k base**  **Him:  $90k base** but guaranteed overtime and approximately takes in **$145k.**  Side jobs an extra $2000-5000 per year.  He will be getting a raise to $110k but less overtime in December.  Likely $120-130k gross to be safe when we purchase.  So a combined **$260k.**\n\nTaxes are NY state taxes - no city taxes.  Home taxes are generally cheaper in the bounds of NYC but the houses are more expenses here.  We could also commute by rail (cheaper house, higher taxes up to $15k), but it would increase our transit expenses (which are mostly pre-tax at least).\n\n**Retirement savings combined:** $600k\n\nWe both max out our 401k's and he has the option to do an additional $19k per year which he usually does so that is **$57k off** the top of our gross.  We also both do pre-tax transit and FSA so that is another **$840 a month off the gross** but we spend it on transit expenses listed below.\n\n**Down payment savings:**  $250k - We have another year to save but starting to look at neighborhoods.\n\n**Other Savings:**  $80k\n\n***Combined*** ***Monthly average expenses currently aside from housing/utilities***\n\n**Car Insurance:**  $250\n\n**Transit Other:**  $400-700 per month (gas, trains, subway, parking)\n\n**Food:**  $600-1000 (eat out a lot, hard habit to break since we work a lot)\n\n**Cell phones:**  $90\n\n**Cable/Netflix/Sports packages:**  $180\n\n**Clothing:**  $120-300\n\n**Gym:**  $300-450\n\n**Student Loan (only one remains!):**  $67\n\n**Health/Co-pays:**  $40\n\n**Toiletries/household stuff:**  $50\n\n**Vacations/ski trips (at least a couple per year):** $250-500 /m\n\n**Miscellaneous entertainment/concerts/happy hours etc:**  $500\n\nThese are basically realistic expenses without looking at it with a fine-tooth comb.

    "I need to purchase a car for work and I intend to drive it into the ground (200k plus hopefully) \n\nI can get a new 2019 Hyundai Ioniq for about 22k or a used 2017 with 1.6k miles on it for 19k but a higher trim package.

    "Hello all!\n\nFor various reasons, my girlfriend cashed the majority of her paychecks and kept the cash in her room for a few years. She has $7000 that she'd like to put into a high-yield savings account, preferably Ally. Obviously Ally doesn't accept cash deposits, but she can't deposit the cash directly into her usual checking account because she doesn't want her family to see how much money she's saved. Their accounts are linked and changing that isn't an option right now.\n\nIf I were to deposit the $7000 into my bank account and then immediately transfer that to the savings account, would there be any issues? I'm not sure if there would be any red flags for a person moving that much money around without a clear source. They're cashed paychecks, so she's already paid taxes on the money. I guess I'm not sure if this is a bad idea or not.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!", 
    "Hello,\n\nTo make a long, long story short, I (22F) have an Edward Jones account that I inherited through another family member at a very young age. It was never explained to me what the account contained as far as funds and stocks go, I just used the money initially to pay for a car and get myself through college. To give some insight, I currently have about $50,000. $43,000 in mutual funds at EJ, $5,000 in stocks, and $3,000 in a money market account. Currently, the money is being used for my graduate school tuition, which is about $4,000 left for the time that I will be here. I don't have any debts (student loans, car payments, credit cards, etc) and would consider myself genuinely responsible with my money.\n\nI have not had a great experience with EJ, or at least the branch that I am with. The branch is in my hometown where I no longer live and don't plan to move back to. I am currently in graduate school and cannot work due to the obligations that the program has me doing (I have to intern and while I make a stipend, it is not enough to cover living expenses). So, I'm living off of the savings that I made while working over the summer after graduating last year. Per my financial advisor at EJ, I should have gotten a job or two while in grad school and should be leaving the EJ money alone for retirement. I currently have no other family members to assist financially, so this money would be really helpful (in my opinion) when emergencies arise; however, I feel like I do not have the freedom to use the money how I would like to. I don't live in the best/safest apartment, I feel as though I have to be frugal with my bills, and I felt guilty when I needed money for a laptop for school as I was told by my advisor that I was not saving properly. A different time, she moved my money around without asking me my opinion and when explaining what she did, she didn't apologize or explain what the reasoning was. So I feel really out of the loop sometimes as I still have not gotten a clear explanation of what the account holds.\n\nTo be clear, I don't want a lavish apartment or to waste my money on trips or nicer things by any means. I just feel that the negative comments by this person makes me feel guilty about the rent money I will need in the future, other expenses, buying business clothes for my master's internship... etc. And I suppose I feel a little selfish because it is *my* money, so I feel like I should be able to spend it on things that I need.\n\nSo I guess here are my questions:\n\n1. Should I request a different financial advisor, such as one at a branch who is in the city I live in now, and see if I can talk to that person more about what the account contains?\n2. Has anyone else had a bad experience with EJ and if so, what did you do about it?\n3. Should I pull out of the EJ account altogether and put the money somewhere else? And if so, where and what would be most beneficial for someone my age?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading and I would appreciate respectful and helpful responses as this is all confusing to me.",

    "My wife and I are looking to invest some money, to diversify our investments with money that was otherwise sitting in our savings account. We were referred to a company from a colleague that spoke very highly of them. We spoke on the phone and here is the info they provided. We are looking to see if this seems like a good deal or if this is run-of-the-mill and we should keep looking for another investment company. First, our details;\n\n- Income: $170,000 before taxes\n- Rent: $1000\n- We max out both our Roth IRAs, so $12,000 per year between the the two of us (new rules woo). Total saved so far about $42,000 saved.\n- We contribute to our work 401Ks. Between the two of us, about $11,000 saved. \n- We save about $2,000-$3,000 per month after other bills, etc. Currently have about $20,000 ready to invest. \n- Rough estimate is that we have about $80,000 saved right now for retirement, we are each 27. Looking to play with $20,000 of that.\n- Goal is to grow our money somewhat aggressively, with some safety net in case we want to pull out a chunk for something like a down payment on a house. \n\nNow, onto the investing. The company provided us with the following plan options:\n\n1. Index-based portfolio. 80% in equity (26% Vanguard Value ETF, 22% Vanguard Growth ETF, 19% Vanguard FTSE Dev. markets ETF, plus two others amounting to 13%). 20% in Fixed Income (10% Broad Market, 6% short term, 4% corporate bonds). The 80% portion has been showing poor returns over the past year, but but have a projected 3 Year from about 4-9% growth. 20% portion has about a 2% return over 3 years on average. \n\n2. Managed fund portfolio. 80% equity (48% large blend Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF with 9% 3 Year return. 32% Foreign in Vanguard Total International Stock ETF, 5% 3 Year return). 20% fixed income (14% Vanguard Total bond market ETF with 2% 3 Year return, 6% in Vanguard total international bond ETF with 3% 3 Year return. \n\nThe company charges a 1% fee on invested funds every quarter. So my questions are:\n\nDoes this seem like a safe/good plan? Should I expect better? 1% seems like par for the course for investment companies. Do these investments match our plans for moderately aggressive investing with a safety net, if that makes sense. Should we keep looking?",

When vacation comes we take this debit card to control our spending when away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe account charges $3 for paper statements (Rip off I know) so we have had digital statements for > 3 years with no fees.

They contacted via phone apologized and confirmed again that the online banking was closed. They again told me they did not have any notes about the closure. I asked for a date the online banking was closed and they said they could not provide that info to me.

(Yes, I know PSLF is effed, but I'm still carefully banking on it someday since I work at a nonprofit and have been diligent in checking all of the right boxes each year.)\n\nThe balance of the federal loan in question is $4232, and the interest rate is 6.55%. I was planning on aggressively paying it off with a $300 payment every month, but I hate watching the money go from my paycheck. Paying it off now would save me around $200 in interest vs. paying the $300 a month.\n\nHere's where my hesitation lies: I would have to take money from my emergency savings to pay it off, reducing my emergency savings by more than half. It would then have about 3 months of living expenses rather than the 6 I have socked away now. Being able to save that $300 a month would effectively get my emergency savings back up to the 6 months it's at now by January 2020.\n\nI have no credit card debt, I'm putting money away into a high yield savings each month, and I'm maxing out my retirement match at work (I put in 8% and get 12% from my employer). My job is stable, I'm in good health, and the hope is that nothing in our house breaks or explodes anytime soon. Is it relatively safe to pay this loan off or should I just keep chipping away at this for the next year or so and leave my emergency savings alone? I'm paranoid about money so I can't tell if that's where my anxiety around this is coming from or if it's truly not worth doing.", 
    "Hi all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNewbie question here.  I am completely new to investing in a regular brokerage account (non-retirement), as I only invest within my 401k and IRA account at the moment.  A friend of mine constantly tries to convince me to play the stock market, and texts me randomly, saying things like \"Apple dropped $X, invest $5k or whatever you can afford now!\"  Then a few days later he tells \"I just made several hundred dollars by selling off my Apple stock, you should have listened to me and bought!\"  I talked to him more about it this weekend, and it sounds like he is going for super-short-term capital gains (holds the stock for days, at most, and sells when the stock rebounds).  I asked him, \"but what about the tax implications... don't you take a tax hit by only holding these stocks for a few days?\"  He told him he doesn't worry about the tax implications because he hasn't withdrawn any money from his Ally brokerage account yet; he simply uses any gains to keep his investing going and will worry about the taxes at a later date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis doesn't sound right to me.  Am I missing something here?  I thought you pay taxes when you have the capital gain, dividend, etc.  Wouldn't Ally send him tax documents (whatever the form is for brokerage accounts) at the end of the year?",

    "Hey guys.\n\nJust looking for some advice...\n\nBasically I have two credit cards, one with a \u00a31500 limit and another with a \u00a33500 limit.\n\nAt the moment the \u00a31500 card is fully paid off as I start to slowly get myself out of CC debt caused by poor financial choices, but the \u00a33500 card is completely maxed.\n\nNow I\u2019m sort of responsible with the \u00a33500 card, in that I pay the minimum and a little more if I can every month.\n\nThe issue is once the purchase interest goes on  I end up over limit by about \u00a3150, which in turn makes the minimum payment around \u00a3250 when it shouldn\u2019t be that much.\n\nI am starting to pay what is called a \u201cboosted payment\u201d of \u00a3350 per month in the hopes of combatting this and get the card paid off by June/July next year.\n\nNow my question is.... is it better to keep the \u00a31500 card paid off and just continue paying the \u00a3350 per month on my other card\n\nOr... would it be better from a credit score perspective if I paid maybe \u00a3750 off the \u00a33500 card with the \u00a31500 card so that they are both safely under their limit?\n\nIf it\u2019s the latter my plan would be to pay the \u00a3750 off fairly quickly whilst still maintaining the \u00a3350 payment on the other.\n\nHope this makes sense.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nPaul",

I'm financing a 07 Toyota 4runner Limited 4WD and a 2016 Yamaha WR250R. I owe 12.1k on the Toyota and 4.1k on the Yamaha. As of right now my plan is to just get rid of the Yamaha by selling it to a private party. I believe I can easily get 5k and actually get some cash back on the sale. Although, by getting rid of the Yamaha it will only free up $120 a month. My Toyota has 128k miles on it but is in excellent condition. I've already spent about 1,000 on parts (including $600 on tires) to get it to be perfect mechanically but it's still a 13 year old vehicle with over 100k miles that I worry about keeping long term. That generation of 4runner are pretty reliable and I have no doubts that it'll go to 200k miles or more. I also do most of my own work so I'm not too worried about things going wrong. Although it's a gas guzzler, I don't do a whole lot of driving. My work is litterally 1 mile from my house and gas is on the cheaper end (for now). I'd be willing to do anything to make my situation a little better.

    " To give a summary I live in my own place with a roommate. I have a full time job working 40-50 hours a week where I make enough to pay the bills with a little wiggle room and that's about it. I used up all my meager savings moving into this place (deposit/rent, setting up utilities, fees, buying all the \"first home\" necessities) and haven't been able to contribute anything really substantial since then to saving or having any kind of emergency fund. I got a better paying job right after moving which has significantly alleviated the stress of making sure bills get paid, but it's still not enough for me to be able to save and also spend a little every once in awhile. I don't go out and I work so much that I don't spend much money. I go out to eat once in awhile with friends but I mostly eat at work if at all so my grocery bill is very low. I limit my spending as much as possible to things I actually need. I also have a dog which adds some expenses such as food and flea/tick meds, and necessary vet visits. I also have about 2k in credit card debt that I accumulated in my first year of being a (financially irresponsible) adult, I learned my lesson real quick and have completely stopped using the card except for my car insurance, which I always immediately pay off plus extra to slowly shrink the debt while helping my credit.\n\nI got my first job at 16 and I've been working full time since I was 17 when I dropped out of high school (that's a long story) so I don't even have a diploma. I've been wanting to get my GED but haven't had the time/energy/mental capacity or money to put into it and it hasn't posed an issue so far in me getting jobs because I've worked nothing but low level commercial kitchen jobs. But now I really want to start planning my financial future and career path. I know for a fact I don't want to work in the kitchen anymore, but it's where I have the most experience and good references and I don't feel like I'll be able to get a job in a different field that can pay me even what I make now. Commercial kitchen work is very demanding physically and mentally, and is extremely draining. I have a very good work ethic, especially for my age, and have been told so by every employer I've had, so I am no stranger to hard work but I also know my worth and know my labor is worth more than most employers are willing to pay someone my age.\n\nI guess my biggest question is what direction should I go in? Should my GED be my first priority or should I focus on finding a different job in a field I want to have a career in so I can gain experience and actually enjoy my job? Should I plan to take out student loans and go to school? My biggest interests are in art/graphic design and illustration as well as writing. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, with many close family members that own their own successful businesses and my dream is to do the same but I'm just not sure where to start. My current job is so draining that I don't have much energy to put into building a business right now and I really want to fix my current situation so I can more confidently approach my future. If there's any information that would be helpful to include let me know and I will add it. Any advice is appreciated.",

I walk or take the bus everywhere, except for maybe one or two Ubers per week (only after a night out drinking).\n\nUnfortunately I also live in a relatively suburban mountain town and it's becoming increasingly difficult to live without a car. On the weekends, my boyfriend (also car-less) and I long to get out into the mountains for hiking/camping. This just isn't possible with public transit or Uber. We also want to get a dog eventually.\n\nLong-term, I plan on moving to a big city in about 3-5 years (think NYC, London, etc.). While this is certainly not a guarantee, it's more likely to happen than not. Thus, if I were to get a car now, I'd likely have to sell it in a few years.\n\nI'm 21 year old woman with no negative driving history (have had a license for years but never my own car). I don't want anything fancy - just a car that can take me, my boyfriend, and a dog on weekend trips. I would still walk/bus to work. Ideally something a bit larger (like a Suburu), but as long as it's relatively safe, I don't care about the bells and whistles.\n\nWhat's my best option here? How much would I be looking to spend with the payment, insurance, and upkeep? Is leasing the best route?", 
    "I am graduating from college (IN) in about a week and will be moving out permanently from my apartment. I live out-of-state (PA) and will be going home for the summer before starting my job in IL. Ideally, I would like to avoid coming back to IN and picking up the furniture here to drive it up to IL for logistical purposes. Instead, I am looking to get rid of a few items here, fly from PA to IL in August before I start working full-time and buy new ones in IL. FYI \u2013\u00a0the furniture is a small nightstand, 5-drawer chest, full-sized bed frame, and headboard, so nothing that can't be easily replaced.\n\nMy question: is it better to sell these items for cash or donate to a Goodwill for a future tax deduction? The offers I am receiving are quite lower than I expected (<50% of what I originally paid \\~20 months ago). I understand that in a college town with many other seniors trying to sell their furniture, I am in no position to start a bidding war. In addition, I have heard that Goodwill gives you a blank receipt where you write down the Fair Market Value of the goods, and I do not suspect I will need an appraisal as none of my items are individually valued more than $500.",

    "Hi all. My wife inherited a sizable amount of money from her grandmother. About $1.4 million all said and done. Our only current goals are to purchase a home for ourselves. But we\u2019re wondering about borrowing against it to purchase several income properties. We live in the San Francisco Bay area, so real estate seems like a daunting but profitable investment. I\u2019m curious about any info anyone could share about taking loans against this money (the bulk with remain in the market), and any experience anyone out there has entering into this competitive of a market. Any info anyone could share related to these types of investments would be ideal. Our end goal would be to expand out into a property management company for these potential properties, as a main source of income for my wife (and potentially myself as well).", 
    "  \n\nI'm a 25 year old working professional who for the past several years has been living very extravagantly and enjoying the fruits of my labor. Recently I have graduated college and gotten a place with my longtime girlfriend so I really want to clean up my finances and start planning for the future. Unfortunately I have made some bad financial decisions the past several years which currently include $4000 credit card debt and $8000 debt on a car loan that I no longer own. In 2016 I bought a 2010 Mercedes Benz for $20,000 but after driving the car for several months it began to have major electrical issues and after taking the car to a few mechanics I found out the car was a lemon. Come to find out the dealership I bought it from sold me a car that had water damage. Around this same time I moved from a luxury apartment complex near my college campus 45 minutes away to a major city and with the inability to drive to car I left it at my old complex. I return 30 days later to find out the car was towed and due to the time period for which they held the car and the location from which they took the car the towing company wanted roughly $6,000. I told them to kick rocks and to keep the car which probably wasn't the best idea but at the time there was still $13,000 left on the loan. I recently got a job promotion making $90,000 a year ($4600/month) and could really use some advice in trying to tackle some of this debt so that I can eventually save up to buy a ring. My current monthly expenses are $1600 on rent and utilities, $500 on (the old car) and a new joint car payment with my girlfriend, $500 on food, $250 on credit cards, and $150 on miscellanies pet cost. I feel overwhelmed and would appreciate any advice on how I can budget and get rid of all of this debt.", 
    "I\u2019ve been in the workforce for about 8 years as a software developer and I never kept a job more than a year, each year I would jump ship for at least 20% increase in salary. I wanted to try to remain loyal to one company. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my current employer for 3 years, at a big multinational corporation. During this time my work was exemplary, I even started a new trend in the corporation that ended up rewriting all their 15 year old applications to decrease development cost and enable features, I\u2019ve been a technical lead and voice within the company, took responsibilities that weren\u2019t mine just to get the job done good and fast. \n\nIn return, I discovered that I\u2019m paid half of what the new developers are paid in the project and when I asked for a raise I was called greedy. So I came to realize that loyalty is not paid off so today I quit my job. \n\nMorale of the story, don\u2019t spend your time in a company if your salary is not matched according to the market standards, even if you love the project, eventually it will hurt you and after all, you are selling your time and expertise.", 
    "Hi! My husband's company uses HSA Bank for their HSA accounts. I have two options for investments - TD Ameritrade and Devenir. Any reason to go with one over the other? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.", 
    "Bought a car exactly one year ago with pretty poor credit, had a 6.8% interest rate.  I'd like to refinance now that a year is up (as I was told I can refinance after a year).  Currently have the loan with Chase bank, is this something I can shop around for?  My credit went from 616 to a little above 750 now, can I expect a better rate?  \n\nThanks in advance!\nChris",

    "About a month ago I had a blood pressure check through my primary care office. I have them every 6 months. It was literally nurse took my blood pressure, doctor came in and said it was good that they would see me again in 6 months. (I did sit in the room between the nurse and doctor for about 40 minutes because the doctor was late that day).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get the bill and I am being charged for a level 4 visit. My doctor office did this EXACT same thing last year. I disputed the bill and they dropped it down to a level 2, I believe, and I saved about $60. My doctor is affiliated with a large hospital system, and they have a new office for billing, that is out of state. I have called three times, left two voicemails, and emailed once over the last 1.5 weeks. Each time I call, I am on hold for about 15 mins then transferred to a voicemail box that has about a 50/50 chance of being full it seems. I tried calling multiple numbers on the website and bill and they all lead to this one department. Also tried asking my doctor office and they said I had to call that department. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do now? I don't want the bill to ding my credit, but I also feel like I am being unfairly billed.", 
    "My accountant is charging me a tax amendment fee because I met with him at the end of March, but I received a schedule k-1 form about a week into April, however according to the IRS' website partnerships must send that form to you by March 15th.\n\nSo basically I'm on the hook for a pretty expensive fee (it's like paying 30% more to file my taxes which is a decent amount since I'm self employed) but this is completely out of my control. They were supposed to send those forms 3+ weeks before I received them.\n\nWhat would the process look like to claim that amendment fee from the partnership? Do I have a fighting chance of getting it? If not, where would I go to file an official complaint to the IRS about this partnership not supplying things on time?"
