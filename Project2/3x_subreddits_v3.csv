"> Undercover filming in a Panorama documentary broadcast in 2014 revealed clear evidence of fraud in at least two testing centres, as students took the test, which is required as part of the student visa-renewal process.
>
> In one, the invigilator was seen reading out the answers to a multiple choice test, while in another, fake candidates arrived to take the test on behalf of those who were due to sit the exam, with the invigilators fully aware that the students were being assisted by paid proxies.
>
> There is no doubt that there was a well-organised cheating system operating in those centres when filming took place; what is less clear is how many people were involved in the fraud.
>
> The Panorama reporter showed the footage to May, then the home secretary, who commented: “What Panorama has uncovered is extremely important. It’s very shocking and I want to do something about it.”
>
> The Home Office cancelled the visas of tens of thousands of students who had taken the Toeic test, large numbers of whom protest that they did not cheat. More than 4,000 have left the country without an opportunity to prove their innocence, having been told that they could be arrested if they did not leave. Immigration enforcement officers visited the homes of more than 3,600 students, as the Home Office attempted to round up all those accused of cheating.
>
> Many of those who believe they have been wrongly targeted have asked for an opportunity to sit a new English test, pointing out that they had no need to cheat as they speak fluent English. Some were studying for degrees in English literature, others were PhD students, and some were nearing the end of accountancy and law degrees.
>
> Those who remained in the UK have been prevented from continuing to study and are unable to work while they attempt to prove their innocence. They are also unable to open bank accounts or rent properties. Many have had to rely on their families, who helped pay fees for their unfinished courses in the UK and are now funding their attempts to have their visas reinstated so that they can continue with their studies.
>
> The allegation of cheating in the UK makes applying to study elsewhere extremely difficult. Most chose to study in the UK because of Britain’s international reputation as a country with good universities and a reliable justice system. Because the Toeic issue has never become headline news, many say their families at home have begun to believe they must have cheated, convinced the UK government could not make such an error.",worldnews

"Dang just went down that rabbit hole for an hour.. definitely a case of mental illness and sad to watch.

"Oh my gosh. She had a complete mental break. Looks like from her FB some friends were trying very hard to talk her down and talk some sense into her. 

She didn't come out and say she was going to shoot up a church but there were references to a previous ""prophecy"" she received about ""exploding"" which is probably what she was referring to at the church. I think she literally thought if she showed up and made people ""martyrs"" by killing them, she would achieve some sort of rapture or something and be taken up to heaven. She literally said 3 days ago  ""The 'rapture' you all are expecting won't be what you think, in fact it will likely be only after an excruciating death. But the martyrs are the only blessed ones. Death is mercy..."", and earlier, ""Well guess what? Apparently the bomb/stone is me. God told me he's a bomb builder, and on the day I explode all the powers of the air will fall. I didn't know what he was talking about at that time, but I think I have a clue now.""

It's like her overall manifesto is sort of haphazardly sprinkled throughout her ramblings and interactions with people on her page over the last few days. 

Who knows what was actually going through her mind; she probably won't really know after she gets the help she needs... I sincerely hope she gets medication she needs. Those poor kids.

"The question about how much family can do in these circumstances has been on my mind lately. Close to where I used to live, an older woman stabbed a 7 year old child on the street, killing him. I live in a super save country with excellent health care for everyone. It's save enough here for kids that age (and younger) walking home alone from school. Everybody wondered what had gone wrong here. Obviously that woman was mentally unwell. I keep wondering if her decline happened very suddenly (Delirium of some kind) or if there were warning signs and nobody noticed. Or maybe there were warning signs and somebody noticed and didn't know what to do. 

I once stupidly stopped while riding home on my bike to help a woman that was quarreling with her boyfriend (?) and had a bloody lip. As soon as I offered my help to the girl, the guy started threatening to kill me and I only narrowly escaped his attack. The police said they couldn't do much. In the coming weeks, the guy was repeatedly brought to the ER where I worked and proceeded to threaten everyone there. When it was bad enough, we committed him to a mental health institution for being dangerous to others, but he always got released after 3-5 days. And there just wasn't anything anyone could do except wait until he really follows through with his threads.

So maybe the family of that woman did see the problem. Maybe she was committed, but if the US mental health care is anything like ours, she just has to rescind her threats and she can't be held against her will any longer. It's understandable (can't lock someone up for acts not yet committed) but also very frustrating.",news

"According to Heavy, her dad is a Navy Chaplain, her mother was a missionary, and her parents met at a bible study in the Philippines. In Christianity, you're weird if God *isn't* your imaginary friend that talks to you. They were probably reinforcing her dilusions. It's called folie à deux - a psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief and sometimes hallucinations are transmitted from one individual to another.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition:
> **Diagnostic criteria for 297.3 Shared Psychotic Disorder**
> 
> A. A delusion develops in an individual in the context of a close relationship with another person(s), who has an already-established delusion. 
> 
> B. The delusion is similar in content to that of the person who already has the established delusion. 
> 
> C. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia) or a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.

Shared Psychotic Disorder sounds a lot like religion.


As a Catholic-raised atheist, I don't know how religious people can tell the difference between their ""legitimate"" God whisperers and people with mental health issues. To me, they're indistinguishable. Everybody says ""God speaks to me"" like it's something to be proud of, even prominent presidential candidates (particularly GOP ones), but when somebody does some crazy shit because God told them to do it, how do they know God *didn't* tell that person to do crazy shit?

How is this Anna Conkey any different from Abraham? 

Gensis 22:
> 22 After these things God decided to test Abraham’s faith. God said to him, “Abraham!”
> 
> And he said, “Yes!”
> 
> ^2 Then God said, “Take your son to the land of Moriah and kill your son there as a sacrifice for me. This must be Isaac, your only son, the one you love. Use him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains there. I will tell you which mountain.”

At what point does someone get psychiatric treatment for their religion? When they talk to ""God"" (pray)? When ""God"" talks back? When ""God"" tells them to do things? So, what, if ""God"" tells you to feed the poor, you're a ""good Christian"", if ""God"" tells you to murder your only son, you're insane? Was Abraham good or was he insane? How can you tell the difference?",news
