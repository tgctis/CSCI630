"Well, that was quick.",sports
"One takeaway from this is how these leagues (UFL, FXFL, AAF, the zombie XFL) aren't competing with the NFL, they're in a losing fight with college football. 

College hockey, soccer, and baseball have a shred of popularity compared to CFB and they have an established ecosystem of minor leagues, some of which have been around for decades. Basketball is the only college sport that can step up to football, and that shows with how the G-League is operated (in that it's very bare bones and most of the teams are within spitting distance of their parent clubs).

The Hurricanes owner buying the league wasn't good for sure, but them moving the championship game from Las Vegas to a much smaller stadium in Frisco out of the blue was the final nail in the coffin. And it seems they aren't even going to make it there.",sports
RIP AAF 2019-2019,sports
Get your merch now,sports
Damn that’s sad ,sports
F,sports
Some guy tried to argue with me that AAF would overtake MLS in popularity lol. MLS is nowhere near as popular as the big 4 but to say the AAF was gonna be more popular was comical. MLS will actually survive and most likely be around in 10 years.,sports
"Curse of Johnny Manziel continues. Everything he's actively involved with since leaving Texas A&M has been snakebit. His run with the Cleveland Browns, both CFL teams, AAF, and now his marriage. ",sports
Looks like Vince Mcmahon's potential XFL rosters just got deeper. ,sports
I didn't even know they started yet. ,sports
"Sounds like they made the same mistake the XFL did and went out of the gates too quickly, and lacked the organization and/or funding to survive. Ironically the XFL 2.0 seems to have learned from and has taken their time coming back, but the ultimate question is whether anyone cares about non-NFL/NCAA football, and the answer so far has been no. College football's popularity has only risen over the years, as has its economic potential. You can't compete with that. 


The only way I see a non-NFL pro football league working out is to go after these top 100 high school prospects and offer them money. Sure, you're probably not going to get the Trevor Lawrence's of the world, but think about these talented kids who wanna make some money quickly. If they could circumvent the college system to make some money for themselves I think you'd see quite a few take the chance, especially if NFL teams grab onto the good XFL players and bring them in. So really if I'm the XFL my main goal is to develop players so you can attract the Trevor Lawrence's of the world and not the Christian Hackenburg's who've already hit their ceiling already (albeit a low one).  


But again, do you have the time, organization, vision, and funding for this? I doubt it.    ",sports
AAF can’t last a season in a country with 300 million + people but the CFL has been around for 150 years in a country with 30 million haha.,sports
"All these leagues act like they can just slap a product together and make it happen. What they don’t realize is that it took DECADES for the nfl to become what it was. 

It didn’t just start one season and become a juggernaught. Hell the first few seasons of organized football saw the rise and fall of teams. Getting sold. Bought. Folded. Other leagues propped up and got merged. Owners had to sell. 

When you are brand new the operation expenses are insane. Most tv stations are only giving you a fraction and most new leagues will definitely try to take the lions share and leave the owners to fight for themselves. Collective ownership that the nfl has is a double edge sword. They pull the weight of the lagging franchises.  But even the worst organization In the nfl still makes more money on its own then the entire AAF league made. 

If you are just starting out just imagine how godly expensive it is to get a group of 50 men plus coaches and staff and trainers and operators from one stadium to the next. Sure the nfl, that’s peanuts. To a startup? That’s a death sentence. ",sports

"Yep, the college game pretty much takes care of the population outside the major city's football and basketball craving.  Teams like Alabama and North Dakota State cover fans, that in another universe, would be served by lower leagues.  (the Huddersfield Town's, Leyton Orients and Barnsleys of the world)  

The G-League can keep on kicking pretty much since it's so much cheaper than a minor league football and is directly sponsored by the NBA.  Same with minor league baseball, and in that case, the system has been around for generations and is widely understood as better quality than college baseball. 

I honestly don't see any minor league football league succeeding unless it is an extension and connection with the NFL.",sports
"Basically these leagues are where 

1) Washed up guys go to continue playing football and dream of being called back up to the bigs.

"I've been following the AAF since the announcement and from what I can tell it boiled down to lack of funding. 

No red flags were raised from a operational standpoint aside from a missed paycheck. 

The on-field performance was good and improved. Attendence in non-NFL cities without bad weather was decent and the tech has potential (which is the only reason some people are saying Dundon bought the league).

Overall everything looked to be close to what was expected/promised...but they ran out of money. 

The questions are:

Did they underestimate the costs of getting the league started and continue to run?

Did they underestimate profits from TV deals/tickets/merchandise?

Did they have other investors drop out? (At one point Ebersol claimed they had funding for 3 years)

Did they think they could attract more investors than they actually did? ",sports
"CFL is interesting.  There was a time it was as big as the NFL and shown on major US networks, expanding to the US, to not being able to make payroll, and now having a sort on renaissance. ",sports

I went to a a Birmingham Iron game at Legion Field about 6 weeks ago while I was visiting my friend. We only went because we could get in for $10 with student ID’s. It was a great place and atmosphere to be drunk at but the football and facilities needed lots of work. ,sports

"They embraced the Canadian aspect of league, and stopped trying to make it in the US",sports
I’m not only talking about the AAF when I say the NCAA is a cartel. ,sports
"You're getting downvoted because you're just wrong. If you think the MLS is a 'retirement league' then that violates the comment ""get called up to the Bigs"" because Wayne Rooney and Zlatan Ibrahamovic are not interested in a ""call up to the bigs"" -- they went, they conquered, now they're having a little fun. 

However, if you think the MLS is a development league for Europe, where guys like Miguel Almiron or Alphonso Davies ""get called up to the bigs"" in Europe, then the part of the comment ""washed up guys continue to play"" doesn't make sense, because these are rising young stars.

"Edit: Found more information, see below:

Original comment: Interestingly, Wikipedia only mentions Eric Money in this but doesn't give any details.

    ""He is the only player in nba history to have played for two teams in a single game. This happened because of referee Richie Powers.""

The article on Richie Powers doesn't mention it at all.

Update: ESPN has an article on why this happened. Apparently a portion of the game had to be replayed and the players were traded before the replay occurred, so they played for both teams in the same game but some (unknown to me) time apart.

     ""I checked with an NBA official, and he said the rule is whatever team you have at the time of the replayed portion of the game, that's your team. It doesn't matter who gets traded or injured or if somebody retires.

   ""This actually happened in 1979. A game between Philadelphia and New Jersey was protested and, before the replayed part of the game could happen, the two teams pulled off a trade.

   ""Harvey Catchings went from Philadelphia, then was traded to the Nets for Eric Money and Ralph Simpson.

   ""All three players were in the box score for both teams. Money scored 23 points for New Jersey and four for the 76ers.""

This was my thought as well...,sports
"Many fans get irrationally attached to their team and players as if they have some ownership claim just by virtue of living in the same city as the team. They don't understand why the players aren't as loyal as the fans, forgetting that the players were drafted or signed to play in the city, not to call it home for the rest of their lives. The ugly truth is that every single one of those fans would also move to another city for that kind of pay raise.",sports
Prob cause he went to their rival. Or at least thats what my friend said when we were watching the game last night. ,sports
I mean we offered 10 years 300 million... he went for 13 years 330 million. I know the extra 30 million is a lot but its not like we just low-balled him,sports
"It was a decent offer. $300m over ten years. Harper wants to win and didn’t think DC had the team at the end of the season when offered the contract. So the Nats used the money to build up the bullpen (which basically meant start from scratch), fill the starting pitching holes, get two MLB caliber catchers, and make the team a contender. Us fans wanted to see our seven year veteran come back, but in reality we don’t need him. Our outfield is already set with a couple of young talent players (Soto at 20 and Robles at 21). Eaton at 30 doesn’t hurt too. We’d rather see the money spent on resigning Rendon. He’ll be a free agent at the end of the season and will be a bigger asset next off season to the team than Harper was this past off season. The Lerners (owners) used a good chunk of the loot they offered Harper on SP Corbin and a few others, but Ted wants a Series ring and will spend what’s necessary to get the right pieces in DC, even though they say he won’t. And if I remember right it’s his son that actually makes the payroll decisions. 

Point to the story is the Nats know what they need and Harper wasn’t in the off-season agenda. They gave him the opportunity to be apart of it, but he said no and now we trek on without him. The offer was a curtesy (and a use to draw more people).  If Bryce doesn’t want to be a part of what we’re going to accomplish in DC then fuck him. He’s now just dust on our trail to fame. ",sports
i mean they've been around for 15 years and have yet to win a playoff series... I think anyone who's still avidly following them are pretty hardcore,sports
"Nats fans are either DC locals that were here when the team founded, or are someone who moved to DC and did not have a baseball team beforehand and wanted one.

I moved here a few years ago and I never had a baseball team, but I also don't really care about baseball that much so I don't consider myself a Nats fan, even though I live here.

"Hakuho is honestly one of the baddest men I've seen in any sport. Just emanates Big Dick Energy. He knows he's better than you, doesn't have to do anything more than stare at you to get that across. Then he beats you, usually humiliating you in the process.

Probably the best moment of the tournament was his [staredown with Takayasu on day 14](https://youtu.be/KrwlqR0kd2s?t=1217). Hakuho thinks Takayasu is taking too long to start so makes a very clear false start just to make a point. Hurry up. Then they crouch to go again, but Takayasu stands up.

It's expected that the lower rank will ready first but Takayasu isn't doing it. Takayasu stands there and refuses to go down. Hakuho starts imitating everything Takayasu does. He stands up when he does, he wipes his feet when he does, then he just stares at him. His point is simple. You ready first. I'm Yokozuna, not you. Bend the knee.

Finally Takayasu gets down and you can just see the intensity in the way Hakuho follows. He's going to teach him a lesson. His first attack is to slap Takayasu across the face. Then he pushes. He doesn't evade him or use any clever tricks, he just uses brute force to push Takayasu out and onto his back.

Then at the end he helps Takayasu up. He doesn't even allow Takayasu the dignity of continuing to treat him as a threat. It's over, your insult has been dealt with. Hakuho will not remember you.",sports

Nah, he's a pro, he knows this is buildup. Im fine. I'm totally good here. I am FUCKED. JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL IM GONNA DIE.""",sports
"This was incredibly informative, and made me respect the big man (hah they're both big) even more. Thank you!",sports
Reminds me of Mike Tyson and his insane intimidation technics and psychological warfare. Amazing shit ,sports
What’s the word on his injury?  The end of day 15 looked bad.,sports
This is such a good explanation.  I've never really understood the appeal to sumo.  But this helps me see the strategy and makes it much more fun.   ,sports
big dick energy is all i need,sports
"I didnt know much about sumo, and kind of wondered what was going on in the video, but your description gives a huge insight into the sport and the respect it demands, and after googling  the guy....I get it",sports
"I don't know what's better: the look of fear and apprehension on Takayasu's face, or the look of anger and impatience on Hakuho's face. ",sports
You just gave me a whole new understanding and appreciation of this event. Thank you!,sports
What a fantastic description of what happened! Thank you!,sports
“This guy’s a legend. I’m gonna piss him off. WCGW?”,sports
"So helping someone up is a sign of disrespect in sumo? I don't follow it at all but it's the opposite in basically every sport I do follow.

That's a neat little detail I never would have known otherwise. Thanks for this!",sports
Nice.,sports

Lots of tradition in sumo. Tons of rituals and such during each day/match.,sports
"The chonmage is the haircut all sumo wrestlers are expected to wear.  The ones you see that look like a half-fan on top are worn by a sekitori, a ranked rikishi (sumo wrestler) of the top two divisions during formal events.

"The next tournament is in May but when it comes around, [Grand Sumo Awesome](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Gx_R_x7iuvf9cBRHmrSHQ) and [Robert Mensing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgW_qyy8E0wQyGOjjXHlitg) both upload NHK's daily English language highlights videos to YouTube.",sports
Underdogs are always popular.,sports
Who needs reddit recognition if you are already being God like worshipped by the Japanese ,sports
Or a boxer named after greasy foods who only ever fought horrible boxers and who’s crowning achievement was not dying against a guy in his mid 50s.,sports
There is r/sumo of course. The English Japanese news site nhk does 25 min recaps after every day of the basho https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/sumo/.   Also you can go to Grand sumo awesome amongst others who post stuff on YouTube. ,sports
In sumo? The sumo wrestler would win. In being a lineman? The lineman would win.,sports
Just a guess but I imagine a sumo wrestler would be an amazing run blocker because the main goal is to push people out of an area. Pass blocking would be much harder as you have to move backwards which goes against their training.,sports
"Some Sumo wrestlers have tried and been mediocre at best.  A high level NFL lineman would likely wipe the floor with most sumo.  Quite simply NFL players are bigger, faster, stronger, and more athletic.

People follow the money and if Sumo wrestlers were on a comparable level we should see at least a few in the NFL. Making, at the minimum salary, more than any yokozuna.",sports
The ref in sumo is called a Gyoji and he's basically a psuedo-shinto priest presiding over the bout. He's yelling at the wrestlers to keep fighting over and over again until the bout is over. Sometimes he will yell at them to speed up if they're taking awhile to resolve the bout.,sports
This guy isn't from Japan.  He's Mongolian.,sports

I agree though - you don't want to give Hakuho any time to compose himself if at all possible.",sports
That's Tochinoshin from Georgia. He sustained a pretty bad knee injury in 2017 so he probably takes injections for that. ,sports
"They cracked down on it pretty hard. Of course you can never know for sure, but at least it seems that way.",sports
They're band aids. That guy hurt his knee pretty bad in 2017 so he might be taking pain killer injections so he can compete or it could just be steroids.  ,sports

"In most sumo stables, the wrestlers are trained to do stuff like the splits. I think the more senior wrestlers don’t focus on that as much, but it’s there at the beginning. ",sports
Absolutely dismantled that guy,sports
Could you explain what happened in the first false start? It seems like both were set,sports
"So actually no, it's still polite to help your opponent after the bout. It's not disrespect at all he shows by doing that, but that's kind of the point. Hakuho simply does not consider Takayasu to be his rival, therefore even when disrespected, he does not treat him like one.",sports
It isn't. Helping someone up is uncommon but not unheard of in sumo and definetly no sign of disrerspect. That is utter nonesense.,sports
"And she's female and hot?

&#x200B;

...*Nice....*",sports
Is there a sort of league I can follow or something?,sports
[deleted],sports
Unfortunately Hakuho is mongolian which makes everything he does wrong by default for many japanese.,sports
"Wait, who is that?",sports
"On Youtube:

Thanks !,sports
"OK so that's the simple answer no one cared about. What about in other exercises that would test their similar abilities like stopping a strong opponent from pushing you back, footwork, etc.?",sports
"No, I just wish I was born in Japan lol. ",sports
"Illegal use of hands, face mask, holding, unneccessary roughness, etc",sports
Are sumo wrestlers tested for performance enhancing drugs? ,sports
"Thanks!
I hate it when something this cool and impressive is cheapened by something like that.",sports
I think they are probably nicotine patches man. I am not trying to take light any achievement of a wrestler....but be reasonable. ,sports
"Hakuho's left hand was around  his hip, not on the ground yet.",sports
"It isn't always perfectly enforced, but by the book both wrestlers are supposed to have both hands touching the ground before they begin.",sports
"Afraid not. Top division sumo tournaments happen every 2 months, in January, March, May, July, September and November. You can always use those channels to dive into past tournaments however. I'd highly recommend watching the March 2017 tournament if you want to see the sport at it's most dramatic.",sports
"If you have NHK's international broadcast, they'll re-play a condensed version of the tournament that takes out the space in between bouts. I'm not sure it's good for a purist, but it is probably a bit easier to get into it.",sports
You want to set it for the [12th actually as that's the start day](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sumo-schedule/),sports
"That is such a shame. His performance is stellar, when was the last time a Japanese had a Yokozuna title? Is it common for Japanese to perceive foreign citizens holding the Yokozuna title negatively? I am genuinely curious.",sports
"They train entire lives for different events completely. A lineman cant do a lot of what a sumo wrestler can. A linemans speed and footwork will likely be better, as lineman do get that big, but not *that* kind of big and train very heavily to stay on their feet under specific conditions you see in football. 

A sumo wrestler doesnt have to hold a guy back and keep him out of an area, so hes trained for something completely different than a linemans job.

Its comparing apples to oranges, although they look very similar, are very different challenges all together",sports
It's also the only real answer. Strength is a skill. Skills are specific. That's how it is. Ask a more.... specific question? ;),sports
They introduced anti-doping protocols sometime in the past ten years and they do medical screenings before each tournament but they probably keep a tight lid on things because if it got out that high profile sumos were doping it would tarnish the sports image and end up costing them money. Nobody can say for sure if they take performance enhancing drugs but it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of them did since most top athletes take some kind drug to give them an edge.,sports
The mind games are fascinating to see. Thanks for explaining!,sports
Where would I find those?,sports
"The last japanese Yokozuna Kisenosato just retired because of injuries. He severly underperformed because of said injuries. Before him, the last japanese Yokozuna retired in the early 2000s.

The funny thing is Hakuho used to be the good guy. Fellow  mongolian Yokozuna Asashoryu was the scandal guy. But after he was forced into retirement because of a brawl he had, Hakuho became the new victim of the sumo elders critics. And in comparsion to the stuff Asashoryu did Hakuho is really a saint. 

It is just sad bc you see a one of a kind athelete, someone with a skillset we will probably never see again - and a whole nation does not care because he is mongolian anbd just wants to see their next japanese hero. I think that must be pretty frustrating.",sports
Imagine a top tier rikishi learning how to play center and protect the QB. Pretend the QB is the center of the ring or something like that. It'd be pretty cool.,sports
"Any time.  Sorry for not explaining much in the first comment.  I forgot I was in r/sports and not a sumo forum, and I have a tendency to forget not everyone watches sumo all the time.  XD",sports
"[This channel has playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/robm999/playlists) for the last couple years of bashos, so any one you'd like to watch you can hop right in. The one I recommended isn't there as a full playlist though [but the first day is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJJ417bcEhg&t=). Autoplay should do the rest, just note the title of the current video and what the next day of it should be.

I'd also recommend the short [sumopedia](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3gh8X4dSmUB72HKrQldb4ziq4rlWyLRk) videos as they help explain a lot of parts of the sport like rankings, how the tournaments work, what certain japanese terms mean etc.",sports
"I didn't realize he retired. I remember his promotion was a big deal, but a bit controversial. He didn't really have the number of big wins you expect to earn Yokozuna, but people defended him by pointing out that it's hard to win when you're a contemporary of Hakuho.",sports
For sure I'll definitely take a look at those. Thanks!,sports

Crazy how successful the Big 3 has been with the AAFs failure in the backdrop.,sports
TIL BIG3 is a professional 3-on-3 basketball league. They play on a half-court. ,sports
Not sure how people are finding time to watch extra leagues. I've cut down so much sports watching because I couldn't keep up with 4 leagues and college.,sports
"look out, espn. cbs is coming for you.",sports
Anybody mention yet how crazy the Big 3's success has been compared to the AAF?,sports
Lol who watches this league? I know it’s anecdotal but I’m friends with a lot of mega sports fans like myself and have never once talked about it,sports
"It’s crazy how everyone finds it crazy that this is more successful than the AAF. 

Crazy",sports
Did the Big 10 downsize? ,sports
"In recent years, Fox Sports has lost the UFC to ESPN, UEFA Champions to Turner, and the Big 3 to CBS.  But hey, they picked up golf, bowling, and the Westminster Dog Show.",sports
How 'bout a video game?,sports
Pretty crazy how the BIG3 is so much more successful than the AAF.,sports

I really want to enjoy the big3 but the color commentator ex-comedian guy just gets on my nerves. Maybe I should just watch it muted but muted basketball is kind of boring.,sports

"If they can get Kobe at some point it’ll be so fun, and it seems like there’s at least a small possibility he would do it.",sports
The overhead costs between the two are not in the same galaxy.,sports
"I think the Big 3 having retired players with positive name recognition helps a lot. The recognizable guys in the AAF are mostly draft busts, like Trent Richardson and Johnny Manziel, and you kind of know they don't really have a future outside of that league. But the Big 3 has the expectation of just being an encore to an already successful career, so even if guys like Corey Maggette and Baron Davis aren't at the peak of their powers anymore, it's still fun watching these guys knowing this is a victory lap more than anything.",sports
"It seems as though the NFL/media/and it’s followers don’t really support the AAF, where  in my opinion the whole basketball community actually supports and believes in it and thinks it’s a good idea and actually is fun to watch. ",sports
Interesting. I'm very familiar with AAF but have never heard of Big3 before.,sports
Yeah honestly when the Big 3 was announced I didn’t think it’d be successful and it’d die off fairly quickly. I’m glad it seems to be working out though!,sports
You can not compare the two. ,sports
Not the samething at all ,sports
"That’s because the Big 3 is an actually smart, sustainable business model while the AAF was a fool’s errand, as all spring football leagues are. ",sports
Exactly my thoughts ,sports
Owned and created by Ice Cube,sports
"The good thing with this league is that games are short,  and it’s a good casual watch.  You’re not invested with a team,  but it’s fun to watch legends play.",sports
Because people aren't watching 4 leagues.,sports
"It’s a summer league so only baseball and MLS are on. Plus most people only watch 1 or 2 leagues anyways. Also familiar faces, all of these guys are former NBA players. ",sports
"Not targeting people who watch baseball and hockey regularly. It’s for basketball feinds to have something to watch during the summer, which also happens to be the off season for the other leagues. ",sports
"This is more a knock on Fox Sports, since that was the original channel Big3 was on.",sports
"Yea, multiple times in this very post... I'm hoping this was /s",sports
"Vastly different costs in running the two, anyone (lavar ball) can organize a somewhat successful basketball league without monumental financial risk ",sports
"It’s legitimately really fun to watch. The players are still really good. 

When you reach your 30’s, your skills and your strength don’t go away. You might lose a little quickness, but what you really lose is the ability to withstand the physical demands of an NBA season. It’s fucking hard to play 35 minutes of full court, extremely physical NBA basketball for 82 games in a span of 7 months, plus practicing and working out on off days. 

The half court set up is perfect. It allows players to be extremely physical without being sloppy because they’re less tired when they don’t need to run all the way up and down the court for every change of possession. They play until a team scores 50, so they never stall or intentionally foul. 

I honestly recommend it. They just signed on some great former players like Gilbert Arenas so this season should be even better. ",sports
"I turned it on to laugh at how dumb “pro” half court 3 on 3 basketball with gray haired vets would be. Then I kept watching it. It really isn’t too bad at all, and the structure where it is point based is excellent. Halftime is when the first team gets to 25, game over for the first team to 50. Pretty fun to watch too. ",sports
I mean I'd imagine older fans would like it.  It's watching your generations stars again like the Senior NBA tour.,sports
"The same people that use to watch pros vs joes or watch their local sports show featuring retired players. It’s not minor league baseball, it’s guys past their primes who use to be good ",sports
I watched a few games at my local tap room. It’s the only place I’ve ever seen it being shown ,sports
"The Big 3's just kind of gimmicky. While other leagues try to focus on basketball, this one relies on nostalgia and things like 4-point hot shots. Who knows, at some point the Big 3 could blow up into a legitimate b-ball avenue, but for now, I don't take it very seriously.",sports

"That and they're not competing against each other in any way, or even WITH each other as far as the NBA is concerned.

Completely different product, other than a ball has to go through a 10' hoop.",sports
Well a big part of that is because the big 3 didnt try to copy the nba's formula like AAF tried copying the nfl's. ,sports
"That's true. Also it seems like basketball is the more versatile sport, a relatively slow, methodical game can be just as exciting as the dunks.",sports
"Yep. It might sound silly, but the acceptance and embrace of the big 3 by NBA, players, and fans validates it's existance.",sports

"either way, they're making moves",sports
Do it then,sports
"Exactly this. The 3 on 3 half court game levels the playing field for the older players. If Kobe or AI wanted to play, they could probably do it at at a very high level even in the their 40s. Would be amazing if Jordan got in shape and schooled some fools at 56 years old. If he could still drop 40 points at 40 years old, I'm sure he could still hit some fadeways in the Big 3 in his 50s.",sports
Al Harrington can definitely still get buckets. Just cant run up and down,sports
"You lose cardio, quickness and become more apt to injury and soreness.

Strength and skills stay as long as you keep at it. Most of these guys keep working out. ",sports
Basketball is so pure in half court form. I so much prefer playing pick up half court over full court. ,sports
"I love the free throw rule - it's one free throw total worth the amount you shot for. So a regular foul near the hoop is a two point free throw, a 3point shot foul you shoot a free three pointer worth 3 points, and a 4-point shot is shot from the four point circle and worth 4. A great rule to keep the pace of play going. ",sports
"I did the same.

"Also, the BIG3 is a different format that actually enhances the viewing experience in many respects. The AAF just got rid of some safety rules but the game was pretty much the same.",sports
"Yee that honestly seems below his aspirations. He dominate the league, now he's wanting to pave the way in other industries. Truly an inspirational career.",sports
"That movie was trash too, I usually don't have strong opinions on the shorts but that seriously feels like a ton of lakers fans voting with their hearts.",sports
Plus the name recognition of the Big 3 helps. Most NBA fans will know at least 2/3rd of every roster while the AAF had like a guy or two whose name you knew ,sports
"Big 3 made a smart decision (imo) in having no regional teams and basically going on tour for the season. One stadium worth of overhead vs multiple, less travel costs, less regional fatigue. And less travel fatigue for their players.",sports
Wouldn't funding/money be the only reason for the existence or non existence of a league? What else could have been the breakdown?,sports
I cut the cord over four years ago.  I honeslty would have enjoyed watching the games but I am not picking up cable to just watch minor league football.  They should have partnered with Amazon or Netlix or shit even Hulu.  ,sports
The AAF wanted to partner with the NFL too.,sports
"And having players that everybody knows helps. 

Hell, Allen f’ing Iverson played in it for a minute. ",sports
Football and basketball are sports I guess so there's your similarity ,sports
"Except baseball, golf, tennis, motorsport or WNBA.",sports
I thought I heard something last year about Kobe being involved?,sports
AI was a coach/player at the league's inception.,sports
Iverson was like the face of advertising the Big3 when it first started. He played a few games and he was terrible. ,sports
"Someone just told me what it was. I don't watch much sports because I didn't know about Ice Cube's rec league? It would have made more sense to simply inform me on what it was, rather than to try to gatekeep all of sports, in regards to something that's barely even sports in the first place, but I suppose it's more fun to just be a smug asshole on line than to educate somebody.",sports
"I mean, yes I do, I just haven't heard about this. But yeah, I can see how downvoting me and saying i don't do something is better than answering my question",sports
"It's not about ""how it affects my karma score"" it's about the fact that I admit to not knowing what this is, and everyone just rolls through and downvotes my comment for no reason. 

If 20 people are talking about something, and you say ""What is it you're all talking about? I've never heard of it"" and they all flip you off and leave, that's kinda fucked up.

No one is obligated to tell me anything, but you don't have to flip me off for wondering what it is.",sports
"100% agree with you. 3v3 is a format I really enjoy watching and playing cuz it has a healthy amount of flash/flair in 1v1 situations but also has enough teammates to run some plays. Also IIRC BIG3 had guys like Nate Robinson, Scalabrine, Billups, etc. who nba fans are fond of but weren’t necessarily considered “elite” (Billups was underrated ik).",sports
Showing that even known rapists can be beloved public figures!,sports
[removed],sports
You're definitely in the minority there chief,sports
It also helps they got some older but still athletic enough for that type of game guys to play as well. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf is a sweet swig of nostalgia that made me tune into the league.,sports
[deleted],sports
Apparently two of the largest stakeholders in the league disagreed with how long they would fund the league before an eventual partnership with the NFL. One thought it would take a year and the other thought 3 years. When he realized he wouldn't be recovering his losses sooner he exited the arrangement.,sports
"what about the top level management being either really dumb or really crooked?  

I have no knowledge either way, but I assume things do fail for reasons other than money.",sports
"NFL Players Union prevented players on NFL contracts (practice squad) from joining.  Dundon, the lead investor, said he'd stop the league and pull funding if they could not work the deal to be a development league for the NFL.  So, it's not so much a money thing as it is the plan is not going the way they wanted to (being the NFL minor league) so they're not going to waste any more.",sports
"Tell that to the NFL or NBA. Like it or not, the money that sustains those leagues comes from ad revenue, which online platforms can't match yet.",sports
I agree! They need to get with the times.,sports
"Half the games were on B/R live, which is a sports streaming service.",sports
"They wanted players from the NFL's player pool.  BIG3 doesn't have that issue at all, and it's MUCH cheaper to rent out an arena for basketball games.",sports
"And the fact that both leagues are low-talent versions of a successful, established league?",sports
"Yeah, not much to compete with.",sports
"Kobe has said multiple times he is done with the game of basketball lol , no chance this happens ",sports
I think that was a rumor that he shot down,sports
You didn't ask a question so what do you want us to answer,sports
But you said you didn’t care. Why go on a rant if you don’t care?,sports
"Billups was definitely elite, but point well taken",sports
"Define ""known"". Show me where Kobe was convicted guilty. ",sports
"It was not rape, that is obvious if you do any research. It was consensual sex and she also had 7(?) traces of other men's semen on her underwear. Woman was a tried and true thot.

Yeah he cheated on his wife, not a good look, but they seemingly repaired their marriage and are together to this day.

But if you did at least 5 mins of googling, you'd have known that. Try better next time. ",sports
It's a genius idea they had to make a league perfect for retired NBA players by making a condensed less exhausting NBA season.,sports
It's a pretty fun watch.,sports
So.... he took his FUNDING away from the league which then didn’t have MONEY to pay players and had to fold leaving DEBTS.,sports
You mean management being really dumb **with money** or really crooked **with money**,sports
Except Dundon wasn't the lead investor from the start.  The league launched without a plan in place for the first season.,sports
"...and someone pulling out their money because of it. I understand there a ton of reasons why money would be pulled but essentially one guy didn't get something he wanted, yanked his funding and that was that.",sports
eh NFL you can catch games on Sunday.  NBA I agree with but you can still catch some games on TV.  MLB is the one that really could use more of an online presence.  ,sports
"Never heard of B/R, now I am checking it out. 
",sports
"Big3 has familiar names that people recognize the aaf doesn't. They're drastically different in what they are trying to be. Big3 also needs probably 1/4th the budget to survive.
Just because they're 2 new leagues has nothing to do with 1 succeeding and the other bexoming a failure ",sports
What is this Big3 thing? A new network?,sports
"Oh my God. It's not *how many* people downvoted me. I don't care if my score drops by 300. It's pretend internet points, so that's not the part that bothered me. I don't care how it changes my score.

The part that bothered me, that I do care about, is the fact that people saw me saying ""I haven't heard of this"" and, instead of simply telling me, they downvote my comment, as if I said something wrong, out of place, or offensive in some way. As if my comment is garbage that doesn't contribute anything because I'm not up to date on Ice Cube's celebrity basketball league.

Again, **I don't care what my score for these comments are** I just think it's stupid that not knowing a niche thing is treated the same way as saying ""Fuck basketball and anyone who watches it"" would be on r/sports. 

Instead of educating someone we say ""fuck you for not knowing this."" That's fucking stupid, so it bothered me. Hence the ranting.",sports
Yeah I’m definitely not giving him the credit his career deserves by grouping him with the others. He was really great on the early-mid 2000s pistons teams.  ,sports
"He tried to play dumb and act like he never slept with her, until they showed him they had DNA evidence showing he did, for starters. Lots of shit like that but I’m not doing an hour of research for just this comment.

Would love to hear your thoughts on OJ, considering he was never convicted, so by your logic he must not have done it or it’s not widely known he did.

EDIT: Just saw your comment where you basically said she was basically a whore so she’s obviously lying. Jesus Christ dude, that’s some serious victim blaming horse shit. No wonder you got drowned in downvotes.

EDIT 2: You’re also a fan of the dude who almost raped a girl with a sharp object, XXXTENATION or whatever. You reaaaaally got a thing for abusive men lmao",sports
"So, you can’t get raped if you like to sleep around?  Some dumbass logic whether you think Kobe did this or not.",sports
And eventually as it gets more popular and can pay more money the league will start getting younger players,sports
I was really hoping it was gonna be Baseketball though....,sports
It also frees up roster spots on G-League teams. Allows easier transition into retirement. Just overall good things from it.,sports
"Yes. In other words the league never ran out of funding, an investor chose not to go further. We're saying the same thing in effect.",sports
"No that's not what I meant.  But in a meta sense I guess can't really refute that it would ultimately boil down as you say.

",sports
"I mean...it’s his money. If you were set to lose millions of dollars, wouldn’t you back out as well?",sports
"They have one, MLB.TV. Problem is that the broadcast/cable contracts are far more lucrative, which is why you still can't stream in-market games (plus a few other caveats). At some point the number of cord-cutters is going to tip the scales where broadcast can't afford NFL and cable can't afford the other three major sports, and then you'll see some upheaval. Or the leagues all pull a WWE and go on their own.",sports
"Yeah, I'm not linking their outcomes or saying one influenced the other.",sports
"It's a league of half court 3v3 founded by Ice Cube a couple years back I believe. I'm pretty sure the only differences between this league and a normal 3v3 is that there's substitutes, a halftime, and four point circles a few feet behind the three point line. A lot of retired NBA players play  in it",sports
"No but it calls into question her character and unless you have irrefutable evidence that he did in fact rape her. He’s innocent. 



",sports
"What backwards ass thinking are you on? You're connecting imaginary dots. The point is it was not rape, she was out to make a pay day and she did. It's not hard to look this shit up.",sports
TBH I don’t really want a lot of younger guys that are faster than the older exNBA guys but not as good as some of the ex-NBA players were in their prime. Part of the allure for me is to see some of the guys I loved in the NBA that are now a bit older still get to compete. But I have no attachment to younger guys so I doubt I would watch as much if any of the games if it turned into that.,sports
"Depends on what you mean by younger.  When it started the BIG3 had a age minimum of 30.  They are dropping that to 27, but I don't think that money they can pay was ever going to be a limitation on the age of the players who they can attract as much as how young they choose to go.    ",sports
"and to think, just 5 years ago, those girls were in grade school!",sports
"We are but you’re arguing a semantic point that is wrong. The league would have continues had there been more money, whether from this man or another. In practicality, yes when he left the league for whatever reasoning that was the end but it was the end for purely monetary reasons and NOT because the league could not function without this investor. How or what made him come to this decision is another matter.",sports
Of course but he original argued that the league broke down for a reason 'aside from funding' which is what i was disagreeing with.,sports
"Even WWE relies heavily on tv ad revenue. For now at least the WWE Network is a complement not a replacement.


If you're a fan it's well worth the money though, as a sidebar. ",sports
"I, for damn sure, can't wait until we reach that point",sports
What proof do you have that they influenced each other? ,sports
"Thank you for taking the time to tell me.

I can see how ""I clearly don't watch sports"" because I hadn't kept up to date on things that aren't pro sports.

Fucking reddit...

Thanks all the same, though.",sports
"The second part is accurate, the first is not.  Liking sex is not low character.",sports
I can agree that he’s not a rapist and still disagree with your logic that her’s is inherently faulty testimony just because she likes sex.,sports
I imagine that this is their plan to get guys like you into watching. But eventually they will get players who are better and faster than the former NBA players are. Otherwise in a few years they’ll just have to reboot the team with new players but maybe that’s what they want to do. ,sports
Just meaning younger and better players. I didn’t realize they had a self imposed age minimum. ,sports
"It's a dumb argument to begin with. What business doesn't fail when it runs out of money? It's redundant to say a business failed because it ran out cash/assets when if it had those things it would still be running. 

The REASON the league failed was because a member of the core investors disagreed with the direction the league was taking.",sports
"Yeah, can't wait until we have to pay $20 a month per league to watch games. It will be cheaper for fans of only one league but if you like watching all sports it will be way more expensive than it is now.",sports
"I'm claiming the opposite. I don't think they influenced each other, it's just interesting to juxtapose one's popularity/success with the others popularity/failure.",sports
"Never said it was but any logical person when told about the other partners would have to blink. If you don’t you’re lying. 

You’re also saying the second part is accurate but also arguing that he’s still a rapist with no evidence. So which is it. ",sports
"You like to reach, I can tell that much",sports
"Yea I know they have had players come and go already, like Allen Iverson. I’m sure there will be some younger guys that stick around for multiple years that can start getting fans but if this gets more popular I don’t think they will have a shortage of exNBA guys in their mid30s that would still want to play.",sports
"Definitely a dumb argument, you’re right... we’re basically saying the same thing. No point in continuing. Cheers",sports
"Cynicism, I like it
",sports
Excuse me?  Where did I say I think Kobe did it?  ,sports

"This reminds me of thread I commented on a few years ago. I covered the protests and riots in Ferguson and St. Louis pretty extensively back in 2014 as a freelance journalist. I told a story about the first few days of protests before the national media (other than the AP) got to town. There were maybe 50 protestors on Florissant with a handful of local journalist. In numbers there were probably more cops out there. Just when things started to escalate around midnight every single one of us lost cell service for almost 10 minutes.  I’m not the conspiracy theorist type, but I thought it was weird and there had been a lot of reports about law enforcement using spoof cell towers at that time so I brought it up in a Reddit thread. I was met endlessly with “source”. I was like, “me motherfuckers....I’m the source”. Do I need to write something up and sell it to buzzfeed for you take my word for it? I get being skeptical on the internet. Obviously. But one of the redeeming aspects of Reddit is it gives us a lot of opportunity to hear first hand accounts of things happening in the world. I didn’t really have time to argue at that point and my post history was full of pictures that weren’t anywhere else on the internet because I fucking took them so I just let it be.

"Yeah, and most people don’t understand what does and doesn’t require a source. If something is common knowledge or extremely easy to look up, a source isn’t required. A source is only required if you are referring to something like a specific article or obscure statistic.

For example if I say “there are 50 states that make up USA”, I don’t need to provide a source.

Even if you go find it and prove it wrong once people have decided something it's very hard to dig them out of it. I was arguing with this guy who was parroting something a politician was saying and he kept saying ""it's all on his website, it's all on his website, there have been studies,"" and eventually got real condescending like ""did you *read* the website?"" So I pull up the study, link it in the comment and go point by point showing all of the things that the politician's website ignored in that study that completely undercut the argument, and how the politician cherrypicked one sentence in the study and even misinterpreted that to support his point, which the study overall did not support. Then, because I was curious, I asked him if this actually had shaken his faith in the politician at all, knowing now that the study didn't actually say what he had *just been telling me* it said. 

His response was basically no, it didn't, because the politician didn't agree with the parts of the study I brought up, and gave no reason why he disagreed. 

Literally the study he had just earlier been citing as the entire basis for the policy was now worthless because it didn't support his point. Except that one sentence did so let's just focus on that and ignore the rest of the study because reasons.

It's tough because on the one hand you want to raise the level of discourse and actually dig into something like a study... on the other hand people just go find a study to support something they already believe and won't be convinced otherwise, so 9 times out of 10 it's wasted energy.

"Right? Was telling this one guy dogs cant look up and he's like ""source""",sports
Nah I feel like if it's something easy to find it doesn't need sourcing just because you didn't know it. Now if it's something hard to find asking for a source makes sense.,sports
Especially if it’s something that you can look up in seconds or if it’s basic stuff you should know before jumping into a conversation. If I’m having a real discussion about a topic don’t ask me to source basic background information. ,sports
"I don't think it should be something hard to believe. I think it should be when it's something that's hard to research independently.

Like I'm decently proficient with niche drag subcultures and various references to events that are not popular outside the community, so I don't mind providing information or curating examples for stuff if people seem genuinely interested (again, as long as it's not something they can find by googling key words in the discussion).

The thing that pisses me right off is when I say something easily Google-able about an important topic that they don't want to believe. So they are like ""you need to support that claim"". You can tell they don't even care about whether the claim is true, they just want to make you look bad OR waste your time by making you convince them of every little thing.

You might think I'm splitting hairs with this, but there are some cases where things are really not believable for *a lot* of people, but if they put a bit of effort into looking it up they will see that it's true.

For example, criminalizing HIV leads to higher transmission rates and less safe sex for everybody. I swear to god every time that topic comes up on Reddit, people make me dig up so many references just because they REFUSE to believe it and WANT to continue stigmatizing HIV even at the cost of public health. Often because they feel emotional about some freak anomaly that made it into news headlines despite being exceedingly rare.

But that's not difficult info to look up. You can read up about it on the websites of various HIV/AIDS organizations, the CDC, the White House, and literally hundreds of different academic publications. 

I honestly think it's a form of trolling in some cases. I've noticed it's a particular problem around topics like discrimination in society or political issues involving minorities.",sports

He's probably so comfortable in these moves it may not even have been awfully difficult for him to do this. Frankly, I'm impressed the guy behind him was alert enough to complete the play.

Looking at it again it's mostly one move with a no-look pass behind him. For an athletic professional basketball player this might even be easy, you just don't see it often at that level of play. Westbrook is highly athletic even at that level and is accordingly confident.",sports

Want to know how I know it's difficult to make a pass like this? Because I've played the fucking sport, shit head. You're the one that sounds like he's never set foot on a court. 

Also, where the fuck do you get off just coming at someone like that? I know this is reddit and most people here don't care for sports, but this is literally a basketball thread. 90% of people commenting here have a pretty good idea of what they're talking about. ",sports
"Played ball for many years. I’ve had no shortage of amazing plays that were accidents. 

No disrespect to Russ - who is obviously way more incredible than I could ever hope - but after watching this sequence a few more times, I’m not 100% convinced the pass was intended for Adams.",sports
"This, exactly this. It looks flashy, but if you were to slow it down you realise it isn’t actually as hard as it looks. First off the pass wasn’t “blind.” In the process of him doing the spin move he saw exactly where Adams was. Then if you follow through the clip he spins again after the ball is released for the pass. This spin if you are paying attention is in the same motion through his right hand following through his pass. Really the biggest part of this play is knowing his teammate would keep trailing to make the play, but as a former point guard you always know your big guy is going to trail to try to rebound should you miss, or exactly this situation except maybe an alley-oop off the backboard.

Yes this play is flashy and takes some skill, but I promise you a 13 year old in the AAU system can do exactly this.",sports

They’ve done an episode on him on Science of Sports a few years ago. They did tests on him and whatnot, and that guy’s brain was able to foresee the movements of his teammates and opponents for 3-4s (If I recall right) and that gives a huge advantage when you’ve got a no-look pass going. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was also the case. High Alert + Predictability. ",sports
The impressive thing is the guy who scored was in the proper position. ,sports
That’s why he’s the professional ,sports
And for Russell to process that Adams wasn’t being covered in the time he would spin is insane. The guy is incredibly talented. ,sports

You crash (run at the hoop) the boards(short for backboard) following a teammates shot.

"Funny thing is with some practice I'm fairly confident I can do this little move against someone like you. I wouldn't be a competent player even at your sorry level but spinning and tossing a ball backward is not the tip of the spear as far as things NBA players are capable of. It's not your, it's you're, and I've gotten so bored with basketball I don't even watch it anymore. Being easily amused as evidenced by drooling over this little move helps with viewer retention though.",sports
"Others who have also played the sport strongly disagree with you. I think you also admitted when you do a no-look pass you're fortunate if you hit the target's shoes and I got the impression you aren't spinning. Are you a stump of a center or something? You may find that point guards are capable of spinning and releasing the ball in a general area, granted they aren't 40-years-old playing after work. Perhaps you need to rewatch the clip and gather your balls from the ground as this is embarrassing. Like one guy said, thirteen year-olds might be capable of this although clearly not you. It is impressive that Westbrook does it in the middle of an NBA game but he can afford to make himself look cute. Even if he screws this up he'll just go back to running and jumping better than probably any other guard in the NBA. You loosen up and have fun when you're as athletic as he is, and this was not a very complex move. Contrary to what you believe releasing the ball like he did isn't a unique feat. If anything, there aren't enough plays like this in the NBA to showcase how good these guys should be with the ball. I actually find stuff the Harlem Globetrotters do more impressive than what you'd see in an average NBA game.",sports
I'm not 100% convinced he saw the guy while spinning as his head turned very quickly but the pass was clearly intended for a player in that position. I'd say he was either aware or trusted there being a trailer.,sports

It's the same principle as when you have to adjust your shot on a fade away, your momentum is carried over into the ball.

Hell, I've heard the former GM of the Washington Redskins claim that these guys aren't the sharpest tools in the shed and he's referring to men who study what might be myriad formations. Get over yourself. My response was very apt. Just like my brain doing very impressive technical things while reading your silly comment Russell Westbrook making this play doesn't mean the subconscious calculations he may be doing are impressive at the level of human thought we all should have some familiarity with. That's why I asked the guy if he ever played a sport. I.e. take your brain doing remarkable things under the surface for granted. This play was not that impressive, you just don't see it every night. It might tend to take guys with superlative athleticism like Russell Westbrook to do things in the middle of an NBA game that while others are capable of them they just wouldn't try them. When the competition is at your level I think you tighten up. If all these guys are to play against the enlightened reddit basketball teams I'd put money on every single point guard in the NBA making this move against you clowns successfully. The greatest thing John Cena has uttered is that he has opened your genetic lunchbox and found a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with the crust taken off.

While I disagree with the significance of doing this in a street game I do agree about the significance of Westbrook doing it in the middle of an NBA game, like I've stated multiple times. That doesn't make me lose my mind over the calculations he's doing. You want to have your mind blown, check out a Math Olympiad.",sports

Yeah of course he had to pass it when he completed the move when else would he have made the pass if it’s split decision? And it seems we’re splitting hairs on was it no look or not. I feel he had no other option but to look away and already have the pass in motion knowing the spot the ball is going.

"Just gonna address some of the comments here through my own opinion, nothing personal folks. After reading the comments section followed by reading the wikipedia of this unfortunate crash. (RIP to those who have died in the crash as well as hope the families are doing alright after the one year mark.) The company should have never gave the job to the driver (Jaskirat Singh Sidhu) with only 2 weeks experience with the truck and 1 year driving experience in truck driving all together. The owner of the company, Sukhmander Singh, was charged with violating federal and provincial safety regulations. This includes;

- 2 counts of failure to require a daily log.

- 2 counts of keeping multiple daily logs for a single day.

- 3 counts of failure to monitor their driver's compliance with the relevant regulation.

- 1 count of failure to have or follow a written safety program.

On January 8th 2019, Sidhu pleaded guilty to all accounts. (This information can all be found under the criminal section within the Wikipedia page, will post a link below.)

Now that out of the way, about the truck driver, Jaskirat Singh Sidhu. A lot of the comments here are about blaming the truck driver for missing the stop sign by looking at the tarp that had come loose earlier during his drive. Furthermore, there are a lot of comments saying that it was an honest mistake from the truck driver, a mistake that killed people. In my opinion, don’t take it personally again, is kinda sad. Yes the truck driving company was way in the wrong with safety regulations of hiring an inexperienced truck driver. Yes the truck driver was distracted and was a mistake, he even apologised to the families. Yes it was his fault for missing the stop signs, he didn’t even brake whilst reaching the intersection. (This information can be found under the Criminal, Investigation, and Crash sections within the wikipedia page.) 

Folks, it doesn’t matter about if it was an honest mistake, yes mistakes happen in life. Some minor, some major. Unfortunately, this was a major mistake that cost lives of innocent people. However, all the charges and sentencing was finished by 22nd, March, 2019, and that this comment section is unfortunately filled with people judging the entire event as well as the driver. I honestly don’t know for what reasons why, but I think this comment section should rather be about those who lost their lives in that accident. Cause any day this could happen to us, even by a sober driver making an honest but major mistake. RIP again to all those souls on that bus and try not to take this the wrong way folks. Lots of love.

"Last year right after the Humboldt accident a friend and I were discussing the merit of posting ""thought and prayers""on fb or other media platforms. We agreed the tradition of posting ones sorrow on fb doesn't actually help anyone( of course there is a valid argument as to why it helps but my personal belief is it doesn't). That night putting your stick out for Humboldt went viral.

 When i first saw people putting sticks out I ran to get mine out in front of my house. It really meant a lot to me to show that support. The next day I asked my friend if he put his stick out and he told me he thinks the stick thing is the same as ""t&ps"". I didn't know how to explain to him that it's not the same, there's something about the physical act of representing your home as one that supports the survivors.

My stick stayed out longer than it probably needed to. But everytime I saw it I thought about that tragedy and when I took my stick back inside it made me want to read the victims names again. Idk why I just felt like the least I could do was read their names and acknowledge them.

Although my feelings on ""t&ps"" is pretty much the same, part of my understands it better. When terrible things happen we are left feeling helpless but also feel as if we want to help. I know putting my stick out doesn't help anyone. Neither does reading their names out loud. 

But it's one year later and my stick is back out and I'll read their names again and let them know they'll be missed and remembered. I can't explain why it helps me feel better. I can't even explain why I need to feel better. All I know for sure is the victims won't be forgotten. I'll keep putting my stick out for you boys just incase a game breaks out somewhere.

TL;DR- If you don't want to read me spill my guts at least read these names:

Tyler Bieber
Logan Boulet
Dayna Brons
Mark Cross

"Was playing in an equal league in Alberta this time last year, I was standing in the hallway ready to go out on the ice when an office official told me what happened in Humboldt. That feeling of complete emptiness knowing I had played against many— even fought one of them (Tyler Smith) and that they were just like me. 

The bus ride home was silent that night with everyone reflecting on the preciousness of life. It was so much bigger than sport. Having been traded from the team we were playing I had some of my best friends on that team texting after the bloody-hardfought game to say how much we loved each other. It was a special moment to remind us how small our problems are and to enjoy every moment of life. It could have been our bus that night. Driving to and from all the little canadian towns and cities is a part of Canadian Jr. A hockey. April 6th will forever be a day for me to reflect and remember how fragile our lives truly are and to enjoy the little things.

"I always think about the little shortcuts and mistakes we make where we are fortunate to avoid consequences, and how many times a poor decision could have ended up in a bad situation.  This guy made a mistake at basically the worst possible time and ended up with a catastrophe on his hands.  He has to live with all the guilt that one stupid decision has cost him.

"That's a risky/brave thing to say in this thread. I don't disagree though. I'm sure that guy won't spend an hour without thinking about the lives he took. Its punishment enough that he has to try to live with that. I'm honestly surprised that he hasn't killed himself, I'm glad that he hasn't, there is a high enough death toll already, but I thought he was going to.",sports
"Exactly. The majority fail to understand that this was an accident. He wasn’t drunk, or on his phone, or under the influence. 

He was a young man who just happened to make a terrible mistake. A complete accident.  ",sports
"That was such a tricky trial. I’m very, very, very glad that the truck driver did the right thing as far as pleading guilty right away and getting the whole thing dealt with before the 1 year anniversary of the tragedy. 

It’s not often things like this are wrapped up within a year of them happening. 

Obviously this truck driver didn’t plan to kill 16 people and physically harm 13 others. But it happened, and it was due to negligence, and he was 100% at fault, and he saw that. He will definitely feel guilty for the rest of his life. ",sports
The guilt is one thing. He will of course do federal pen time and likely get out in 4 years. Once released he will finish his sentence in the community and then get deported and permanently banned from Canada.

"On top of that guilt, he will be deported after his sentence is completed.

Basically he will go “home” to a country with no job, no savings, no home, and only distant family (I had read somewhere that most of his immediate family lives here in Canada and plan to stay here).",sports

There were also a lot of people on Facebook here saying he should have gotten 8 years for every life he took (he got 8 years total) which I think is disgusting.

Edit: From the Wiki

> the [RCMP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCMP) charged 29-year-old Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, the driver of the semi-trailer, with 16 counts of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death and 13 counts of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily injury. On January 8, 2019, Sidhu pleaded guilty to these charges and was later sentenced to 8 years in prison on March 22, 2019.


Edit2: 

>Immigration lawyer Richard Kurland said since Sidhu pleaded guilty to a serious charge, it's very likely he will be sent back to his birth country of India once he completes his sentence.

> ""It's not the sentence that counts,"" said Kurland. ""It's the fact that this is an indictable offence.""

> Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada confirms that permanent residents who are convicted of ""serious criminality,"" may lose their status and have to leave the country after completing their sentence. This could also be triggered by receiving an actual sentence of more than six months.

> Sidhu grew up on a farm in India and followed his girlfriend to Canada in 2013. Sidhu is a permanent resident, not a citizen of Canada.

> Under federal law, a permanent resident convicted of a crime that holds a maximum sentence of at least ten years will be deported.

> There are few chances of appeal. He could appeal the deportation order if he receives a sentence of less than six months.

> ""If your actual sentence is more than six months, then you have no right of appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division,"" said lawyer Benjamin Perryman. ""If you're above six months, you don't get this opportunity to argue how serious the crime was, that you've been here for a long time, these are your attachments to Canada.""

> If he receives a conditional discharge, meaning he would not serve prison time but instead live under certain conditions, he could avoid deportation completely.

> Immigration lawyer Kurland said the scenarios that would see Sidhu able to stay in Canada seem unlikely.

> ""I expect there would be a public outcry from coast to coast to coast, based on the facts, that six months would be the (sentence),"" he said. ""I, frankly, would find that hard to believe

This is the most severe penalty ever given for this crime in Canada; the longest sentence previous to this was 6 years. He will be eligible for parole in just over 2.5 years and released in just over 5 years. Once this happens, he will most certainly be deported. 

He is a Canadian resident (not a citizen) and any resident sentenced to a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years or more is subject to deportation. The maximum sentence for negligence causing death was increased in Dec, 2018 to life in prison, but the maximum that applies to the driver is 14 years because he committed the crime before Dec, 2018.

Throwing this guy in jail for eight years along with murderers, rapists, and other ACTUAL threats to the general public accomplishes nothing.

He missed a stop sign. It's something that happens every day, all across the country. It's something that MANY drivers will absent-mindedly do at least once in their life. The results in this instance were absolutely awful, I agree. But the driver admitted to it and plead guilty immediately. He's shown a great deal of remorse, and has apologized to the families repeatedly. 

He poses no threat to the general public. He is not somebody who needs to be rehabilitated or has shown any ill-intent. He wasn't high, he wasn't drunk, he wasn't out to get anybody. He was just a guy doing a job that he clearly wasn't trained to do.

While I agree something had to be done, throwing him in jail for eight years is excessive and won't better him or anyone else. A two year sentence (where he's out in one on good behavior) with removed driving privileges and community service to give him the chance to give back to the community he took so much from would have been more appropriate. It would prevent him from doing anything like this ever again (and let's be honest, he wouldn't do this again ever even if he got away completely punishment free).

"He’d been a truck driver for all of like two weeks and got distracted by what appeared to be his load not being sufficiently secure. If that had been the case and he’d not been paying attention to that, you’d be sitting here saying “securing your load is the first thing everyone learns it’s not just an accident that his load fell off and the bus hit it and it cost people lives!”.

The time to solve the problem was before he got out on the highway alone as a rookie truck driver with essentially no training trying to juggle more tasks than he was equipped to handle. By the time he’d made it out on the highway and several things started going wrong at once it would only have been luck for there to be no consequences.

This is something that we figured out with regards to air travel safety a long time ago. You don’t blame a pilot when through a series of choices and circumstances he was put in a situation to make a mistake—you address the problem where it begins with how the pilot was able to end up in that situation in the first place.

He’s not blameless but throwing him in jail for an extended period of time does nothing to solve the problem. Regardless of the punishment, *this* driver will never make that mistake again. However the trucking company is still sending unqualified drivers out to repeat this driver’s mistake.",sports
"I don't see your point. People run lights all the time by accident, which are also really obvious.",sports
"Your right. He is clearly an awful, dangerous person who needs to be locked away with rapists and murderers for eight years. /s

Dude missed a stop sign. Almost everyone out there absent mindedly misses a stop sign at least once in their life. The results were unfortunate in this case, no doubt, but locking this guy up accomplishes nothing. He's not a threat to the general public, he's not someone who needs to be rehabilitated in any way. He's been remorseful since day one, owned up to it and plead guilty almost immediately. He wasn't drunk, he wasn't on his phone, he wasn't high. He had an honest lapse of judgement that anyone could make while doing a job he obviously wasn't properly trained to do.

Did he need to be punished? Sure, something had to be done. But eight years? Drunks who have caused fatal accidents routinely get far less than that. Fatal hit and runs routinely get less than that. This guy's lawyers tried to convince him that they had enough against his employer and the intersection to reduce his sentence but he immediately plead guilty and waved his rights to a trial to speed up the process so the families would get closure sooner. He wasn't out to get anyone.

A two year sentence (out in one on good behavior) with stripped driving license privileges would have been all that was needed to prevent this from happening again. What's the point of keeping him in longer than that? As a deterrent to others to always stop at a stop sign?",sports

I slammed on my brakes (there was no one behind me or anywhere else around for that matter), and then backed up back to the line. As soon as the light turned green again, I crossed and pulled over to look up the traffic camera laws in that state. Fortunately, the law stated that you could only get ticketed if the camera got a shot of both the front and back of the car and since I didn't go all the way through, it didn't get a picture of the back.

I like to think I'm a decent driver, have never had a ticket or been involved in an accident in over a decade and a half of driving. That being said, I once pulled up to a red light after a night shift, stopped, and then proceeded ahead like it was a four way stop with stop signs. I half realized what I was doing and gunned it to get out. Scared the crap out of myself. Just a brain fart, completely on me, which luckily didn't result in an accident. And that's all it could have been in the Humboldt case as well.

He was driving in rural Saskatchewan, which is probably among the most dull, flat, and uninteresting regions on the planet on a road he had never been on before.

>It was a clear, sunny day and there was nothing to obscure Sidhu’s view of the stop sign, according to the agreed statement of facts. The sun was not in his eyes, the road was not affected by any inclement weather and the intersection was clearly visible before the collision. Sidhu also passed signs indicating that an intersection with a stop sign was ahead. A few trees southeast of the intersection would not have blocked Sidhu’s ability to see the approaching bus, if he had stopped to check for traffic at the intersection.

On April 6, 2018, sixteen people were killed and thirteen injured when a northbound coach bus struck a westbound semi-trailer truck near Armley, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Most of the dead and injured were players from the Humboldt Broncos, a junior ice hockey team that plays in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL).

Guess I missed read the yield as a yield sign and not a stop sign. My point remains that there isn’t anything indicating he fell asleep.

"Thanks for the analogy, kind of makes sense now 👌🏼 ",sports
"Great analogy, but one small thing. Joseph conceded 12, it's 6/12, makes it look even better.",sports
"This is really not the most accurate analogy my dear lad. Sticking with baseball here— imagine if on his debut, Stephen Strasburg (a mega hyped power arm who has been a celebrated top prospect since his teenage years), on a day that his team’s offense only scored 2 runs, thew a no hit shut out and struck out Josh Donaldson (a 32 year old former MVP), Starlin Castro (average player with upside), Craig Kimbrel (a relief pitcher), and Gio Gonzalez. Not quite the hall of fame mantle you say, but this is where the analogy ends as an out in cricket is not equivalent to an out in baseball— a batsmen might bat for dozens of pitches and once he’s out he doesn’t hit again. 

As far as this particular fella goes, he was one of the youngest call ups ever to the West Indies national team and while making his debut today, is a known commodity as a young talent with phenomenal potential. What makes him unique is the incredible amount of power he generates relative to the length of his run up (running windup/stretch). Given his short number of steps, the power he’s generating is incredible. When combined with the incredible movement off the bounce, he’s basically unhittable. Guys who pitch this fast have a longer delivery motion/time, giving the hitter more time to read his delivery, but Joseph has a smooth and compact delivery thrown after a short run up with a superbly deceptive release and the batsmen simply have no chance of being able to read the trajectory of a 90mph bouncing cutter, especially because of the horizontal motion after the bounce. The performance was utterly dominant— out of the 10 hitters on the team (who only bat once each) he eliminated 6 of them. A team might only get 6 guys out total so for one guy to do it, all while throwing unhittable fire all night and effectively throwing a shutout, (His final tally of 6 outs while allowing 12 runs on 28 “pitches” is a league record). 

His dominating arsenal and his still untapped upside make him a really exciting prospect! It’s always interesting to see athletes who advance their sport by inventing a new archetype of player. ",sports
"Haha, nah. SRH is a very solid team, just need to fix out some issues in the middle order bu other than that its good. They're def making it to the playoffs. ",sports
He got out 60% of the opposition team. He only gave up 14 runs (average is probs 30+). This is the best ever stats for a bowler (pitcher) in the history  of the league. He did this in his first ever match in the IPL.,sports
"Pitching a perfect game on your MLB debut, possibly. Not much of an American sport follower.",sports
"He bowled the best game this league has seen in it's 11 year existence, on his debut. This league is the biggest short-form cricket league in the world. The term perfect game doesn't really work for cricket, but it's like getting a 18-20 strikeout game in baseball on your debut.

&#x200B;

If we wanna do some math getting 6/10 people out is like getting 16/27 strikeouts in baseball. But he only (by the rules of cricket you do 6 bowls and then someone else does 6 before you can potentially bowl again) bowled half the game. 

&#x200B;",sports
"Nope. At first contact, some part of the foot was behind the crease.",sports
"That is a REALLY great write-up, thank you! 

I, for some reason, just couldn’t think of a way to tie the significance of that economy over to a baseball game... Thank you for mentioning Kimbrel though, I miss him playing for Atlanta",sports
"Wait, does that mean that cricket games can end really quickly if once you're out you don't bat again?",sports
"Wow.  That is impressive.  So not the equivalent of a perfect game, the equivalent of the best game ever....in his first game.  Nuts. 
",sports
"> in the history of the tournament.  

Which tournament is this?",sports
"That’s right. This form of the game is limited by the number of pitches, but if all the players on the team get out before that limit is reached, they are dunzo and the number of runs they have scored till that point is their final total.",sports
"A game can end really quickly, but you aren't required to hit the ball if isn't going to hit your wicket and you can hit the ball into the ground and not run. You aren't going to score quickly like that, but you can be out there for a long time if you play defensively and are really good.

&#x200B;

This video had people trying to score big and getting punished, people just being bamboozled entirely, and people getting caught out with balls going off the edges of the bat (not too different from foul balls in baseball).",sports
"Well, I guess this begs the question, is a perfect game possible in cricket? Seems like if 14 is considered good, than a nil score would be pretty close to impossible. ",sports
IPL is the Indian Premier League. My understanding id that its the largest short form cricket tournament in the world. Been around since 2008 I think.,sports
"Only possible if you're a national team player and you're playing against the under-5s. I'm assuming getting 10 batsmen out and conceding no run would be a perfect game. For various reasons

1. You cannot bowl consecutive overs. An over is a set of six legal balls. After that, a different bowler bowls from the opposite side of the ground. How things generally work is that two bowlers bowl alternate overs (so say bowler X bowls from the north end, and bowler Y bowls from the south end), and when a new bowler is introduced from one end, it constitutes a bowling change. So, chances are that the other bowler would get batsmen out too, and therefore, you cannot get a 10-for. As a matter of fact, when Anil Kumble got 10 outs for 74 runs against Pakistan in 1999, when it appeared like the 10-for was on the cards, his good mate Javagal Srinath who was bowling from the other end, was deliberately bowling away from the stumps so that he doesn't get anyone out and allow Anil to get the 10-for.

2. Scoring one run is easy in cricket. It's no achievement. A school kid would be able to score one run against a star bowler. A batsman can say he had a good game when he scores 50 runs, or 100 runs or more, or wins his team the game and doesn't get out.",sports
"Yeah, this thread sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole on cricket. I'm starting to realize that batsmen have a lot of attack angles to get a run. What this kid did was attack the wickets with some amazing bounce angles, which seems to be its own damn art. 

But I understand nothing of this... just kind of neat to see. I've always wondered about cricket but every time I've looked into it, it was a just too much. Neat to see some highlights.",sports
"Don't watch highlights. Watch a full game. Highlights show the big plays, but as you'd know in most games, the nuanced strategic aspects come from the regular plays

What are those guy behind the goal doing? Looks as if they are intentionally running towards the net to distract the player with the ball? They almost look discouraged when he scores.,sports

"'Absolutely ridiculous' is more than a stretch, nice goal, but the chip was probably the best part (touch was even off on the previous play).  I'll save the 'absolutely ridiculous' tag for a well struck and placed scissor kick from the 18 on a cross.  ",sports
"Nice goal, but just watch Messi play and you'll see he's consistently on a completely different level. ",sports
"That's considered ""absolutely ridiculous"" nowadays? We should stop the overuse of superlatives, really.. Sure, it's a beauty, but it is not that extraordinary... Just a Zidane move followed by a lob. Very well executed, but not ""absolutely ridiculous"".",sports

He shoots, he scores. The other option would be not to score.",sports
Passes 2 guys and its ABSOLUTELY AMAZING?  Not to be a hater but there are way better goals than this every day...,sports
"He may have been Brazilian, but that goalie has to be Scottish. WTF was that?",sports
Sure looks like he pulls the defender..?,sports
"What the heck are the guys off pitch running after, as. If they wanted to get in the game. That is quite disturbing having people acting like they are on the field. I know they have the extra color jackets, but still... ",sports
"Serious question, are there any white players, playing today, that could make that move?",sports
"I'm sorry, but that's something only people in countries with low level of football are impressed by - here in Europe we call it ""pulling a Zidane"".",sports
Must have lowered the standards for ridiculous then. A spin and a chip? Fuck off,sports
"I do not like how a brazilian player can play for a german club.

It should be local to regional to national. And national do the world cup. But how it is today you can buy the best players from all around the world and suddenly china is the best?(example) The best in what? Paying the most money? What sense does it make otherwise? Country against country and you can buy players all around. So its not country vs country anymore. It about money against money.",sports
Looks just as boring as the 2 other soccer goals scored the past 5 years. ,sports
I kept waiting for someone away from the ball to take a dive and writhe in pain afterwards.  ,sports

Yes ,sports
"I think silky smooth is a bit of an overstatement, amazing goal nonetheless.",sports
"Silky?  Smooth?  Looks like he about tripped over the ball on both touches and it happened to end up in front.  Chip was perfect, though.",sports
Type of goal that just makes everyone lie down in disbelief. ,sports
When you see a goal like this all you can do is applaud 👏 Pure magic ✨,sports
"Fuck young players, this is the type of goal I daydream about scoring in the World Cup final and I’m 20",sports

This type of play is fun for the moment and the kids, but useless for consistency and I just hate encouraging it.  Enjoy the viral video, but you can’t rely on this type of crap.  I don’t mean it didn’t take an immense amount of skill, it just doesn’t do anything for me because I can see right through it.

All these kids wanting to dribble the entire team and then do a “dab” at the end these days is discouraging to actual great soccer.

There wasn't really any passing options on for him as the closest team mate is about 10 yards behind him and he didn't have the time and space to play it back to him either. Taking on the defender and getting past him like that was absolutely the right move in that situation. ,sports
"Yes it's praised because it's incredibly hard to do. And this isn't tactics btw, he got put in a position where he simply has to do it by himself because of a misplaced pass and no one around him to pass to, and it isn't just what he did, it's the casualness with which he did it. They aren't praising the team or the manager, just him for wriggling out of a tough spot. 

And no, Kids don't see this and think it's the best way to play football. The ones that can do it, they keep doing it and go up the levels until they can't do it anymore and then learn to be a team player.

Basically anytime something consequential happens, they want the DC Ops to clip it off. 

There’s also a highlight supervisor who is monitoring the game and communicating with the producer, and they will take spectacular plays like this and send it to editors or post-production specialists so they can implement added effects.

"I agree with that. I said I did.  It was great individual effort, but I was making a point that this type of play isn’t praised by me.  It’s a lucky bs quicky and no real soccer player sees that and says “yeah! That’s the spirit of the sport!”  It’s almost a cheese, and I personally see this and say “meh” instead of “wow such goal! Very nice! true soccer!”  I like to watch a real soccer game, and when called out on it, I just compared the Brazilian team to the German team.  Playing as a team and winning as a group is harder and more skillful than this.  The individual can do some things a team can’t, but overall, a team is the real core and this doesn’t exhibit that.  I compared the team of Brazilians playing for themselves and losing all interest in the game when they were down.  They started fighting each other and being ambivalent to each other instead of coming together and fighting back.  They gave up after the 3rd goal in the World Cup and when I see play like this, I see bad soccer and a quirky goal that doesn’t win championships.  Anyway.  I’m way to far in to this now than I care to be. ",sports

"He didn't pull him at all. Watch it again, the defender slows down and tries to block him off (obstruction) to allow the second defender to clear the ball, the second defender doesn't realise allowing Cunha the time to get in.",sports

"Exactly. Been playing since I was 5 and only at a local club level. People do roulettes every game. It's one of those skills every kid learns because it's simple and effective. Even in this video he doesn't pull it off cleanly but he still broke away from the defender. It eventually becomes a normal part of your game if you practice it regularly. 

Obviously we're a lot slower and it's stupid to compare, but I've seen hungover 30 year olds do roulettes at 10am on a Sunday. ",sports

Wow you must be young. That was around and made famous by Maradona way before ZZ was even a thing.,sports
"There's not a totally clear angle.  The movement of the defender's body suggests a pull (imo), but the close up view has the defender's body in the way.  It also cuts a bit too close to the action to get a perfect idea of the angle of momentum to determine who is ahead, and if it could just be jostling or if it required grabbing.  It's possible it was borderline, and the ref didn't have a comfortable enough view to call it.  It does look to me like he is (while behind) using using his hand to slow down the defender and put him off balance.  I'm not as sure on the technicalities in soccer/football as I am in some other sports so I might be misunderstanding exactly where the boundary is.",sports

"Like I said I wasn‘t able to look at the close up.

In general you can use your arm to slow down opponents as much as you like. There is normally a lot of shoulder to shoulder contact when two players are running side by side for the same ball.

In general: Grabbing (even just slightly) = foul.

Sideways pushing with upper body and parts of your arm (without extending it too much basically, roughly 45 degree angle is fine) = perfectly allowed.

Another hint is the reaction of the defender. He didn‘t complain.",sports

Too late,sports
"So, one and one free throws to tie and go into overtime?",sports
"Well this also plays into the controversy narrative as well.  These refs weren't calling a lot of fouls (like the one before the dd).  So the fact that they called that one at that pivotal moment of the three attempt makes it seem like they were sitting on that one and were going to call that one if there was even a hint at contact.  I agree it was technically a foul, but the refs set a tone of ""let them play"" early on.  It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that they decided to call that one.  I'll move on but I will be mad at that call forever.   ",sports
"But no one recognized it as such in real time.  It's not like the refs saw it and said, ""nah... let em continued"".  No ref saw it, just like no announcer saw it, just like no viewer saw it.  No one saw the ""double dribble"" until they replayed the final minute under a microscope.  To see that it hit the player's foot, as opposed to just bouncing funny, required 4 different camera angles and slow-motion, stop-action replay.

If you want to go back throughout the entire game, I'm sure you could find even more egregious examples of non-calls.  But Auburn fans are focusing on this one non-call because if the refs caught what no one else caught, then the outcome could have been different.

Ultimately it's a matter of Auburn fans refusing to accept that their team lost the game.  It was heartbreaking and Virginia got lucky, but the outcome is real and the sooner Auburn fans accept it, the sooner they can get on with their lives and root for their team in the 3rd place game.",sports
"Agreed, definitely did not notice the double dribble live. ",sports
Yeah but three minutes before that the refs missed another call so....  YIKES!,sports
"There was also a double dribble that previous play, the play before could have been a kick ball foul too",sports
"NO ONE saw the double dribble until they went over the replay with a microscope.  From the refs' angles, it would have looked like the ball just bounced funny.  It's not like they saw it and said, ""nahhhhh... I'm not going to call the double dribble I just saw"".

If not called, (as both teams committed infractions and ref's didn't call either, rightfully imo) then the game continued as it did and Virginia wins on a very poor defensive play fouling on a 3 pt attempt for the win.

Take your pick. I think the ref's made the correct call to not call either the foul on Auburn or the subsequent double dribble caused by the foul from Auburn. ",sports
Nah Auburn was up 3,sports
"You cant just hip check someone while they're in the shooting motion.  It wasn't ""technically"" a foul, it obviously one.  They weren't ""sitting on it"" and it's not like he was flopping, he didn't even kick his legs out.  You have to give a shooter room to land, and you sure as hell can't jump directly into them.  Yeah, it sucks that it decided the game, but it was the right call. ",sports
You should also be mad at the Canadiens forever because their fans are such assholes.  Just sayin.,sports
A foul is a foul. The double dribble is irrelevant because they missed a foul a half a second before.,sports

Yeah, often times the game comes down to: whoever made the last mistake loses.",sports
Shouldn't have even been their ball on the inbounds apparently though,sports
His arm starts going up before contact was made. That's called anticipation.,sports
it 100% was. defender jumped into the shooter and made contact with his legs during the shot. ,sports
"when i say ""correct"" i was just saying that it was a foul, whether it should be called to decide a game is another discussion. it wasn't borderline though, he went into his legs before he released the ball, that's just a foul.",sports
" If you think a ref should call fouls differently on a deciding play vs the first bit of a game I can see why you are a ""former"" ref.  A foul should be called a foul no matter when it happens.   Good riddance former NCAA fan. ",sports
Hahaha sick I’ll just foul the shit out of every game winning attempt then. How dumb do people have to be to arrive at this logic? ,sports
"You can see clearly in the replay as the shot goes up the closest ref closes his fist, which is the standard way to indicate a foul on a shot attempt.",sports
In the replays the ref right next to Guy and his defender whose name I can't remember does call the foul as well I think. ,sports
"It was clearly called by the referee who was 5 feet away, not by someone “across the court”",sports

good grief,sports
"I did a wth take on the ball going back as the auburn player defending was far away. Then freaked out even more when the Virginia player essentially chokes in the moment and picks it up with two hands instead of trying to straight re-establish the dribble. 

I think the officials were caught off guard how it went down. You don’t see a play like that often. It doesn’t excuse it but it’s how my mind copes with how it happened.",sports
Idk about that fella,sports
He lost his dribble because he was fouled and the ref didn’t call it.,sports

I guess the rest of the game was perfectly officiated?  Auburn missed a free throw and UVA didn't.  That's why UVa won.",sports
Exactly. “Those are never called late in the game” is the reaction.,sports
"So the call itself wasn't the problem, it was the call before really? ",sports

[just like this ref here who’s clearly not calling a foul.](https://gfycat.com/fearfulpersonalabyssiniangroundhornbill)",sports
"I've seen and called thousands of fouls; that was not 'just a foul.'  It's a borderline call (yes, I'm familiar with the new emphasis on giving a player space to land).

For that foul to be called in that situation, I need to see that it a) really wiped out the player; and/or b) truly denied him the chance to make the shot.

If you're going to claim b) from above, well, I hope you're wearing Wahoo Orange tonight, because: bullshit.  

People always try to remove context from calls and you cannot.  As the adage goes, you could call holding on every play in the NFL. But you don't; you make the calls to have the game played well.

Same with this.  Making that call is pathetic.  And I truly don't give a shit about either team, but that just turned me off to watching the 2nd game tonight.

Lol can't have it both ways.,sports
"He didn't lose the dribble because of it, but his jersey was definitely pulled and so he was fouled prior to picking up the ball and committing the double dribble.",sports
"It wasn't problematical, just dramatic. The missed double dribble a few seconds before was problematic.",sports
"ok but i am separating it from context when i'm saying that the play itself is a textbook foul. like i said, whether it should have been called in that situation is dicey and i probably agree with you there. 

but looking at the play in a vacuum, as you said with the new emphasis on giving space to land it's a foul to even have your feet under a jumpshooter, let alone make contact with the lower body before the ball is released. ",sports
"Yes consistent.  The final foul was exactly that, consistent with the rest of the calls in the game.  Skipping over it would have been the exact opposite of consistent.  Then again that wouldn't give you a reason to complain.

And if you take offense to the ""former"" ref comment that's rather telling.  When you try to flaunt that u reffed at some point (probably a u10 game for a season), are overtly wrong in the rules judgment, and them immediately give a statement in your next comment that contradicts your first (aka consistency) you aren't doing so well at ""reasoning things out"".

"Baseball has had an unofficial understanding for years where young players will be underpaid.  Once players reach free agency, they’ll make big money.  Teams that sign free agents would get a few years of the player’s prime during which he would (hopefully) help them win a championship, in exchange for overpaying the player during his decline.

But the understanding is falling apart.  Players are hitting their prime earlier, which means many of them are close to their decline phase by the time they hit free agency.  This means teams can often retain their best players for cheap, and sabermetrically-inclined GMs have no desire to overpay players who aren’t going to help them win.  Machado and Harper were able to break this trend in large part because they came up so young; they’re much younger than most free agents, so they are further away from their decline.",sports

No one does a go fund me over a copay. You also don’t know how economics work. people get paid their worth based on supply and demand. There is a big demand for people who can hit a 95 mile hour fastball. Small supply. Hence the massive contract. Rest and relaxation are important for people to perform their best. Some people do that by going to baseball games. Sports and music have played a huge roll in moving society forward. It’s helps bring equality and understanding amongst people and countries. Just because you don’t think they are important doesn’t give you the right to belittle other people’s struggles. Calling people names is immature but dumb shits like you who think they are better than others and talk down to people (when you don’t know their situation) over the internet are even worse for society.

However, baseball for whatever reason is just very weird when it comes to these unwritten rules. Call it players egos, or whatever but its childish a lot of the time.

Well she was almost guaranteed to rely on that degree. Not like there's a whole lot of gymnastics after college.,sports
Probably some lawsuit waiting to happen if they withdrew it right away,sports
Really? Surprising but very fortunate.,sports
"Not that surprising, to be honest. If the bones had fractured, it would have removed the pressure in the knee joints, preventing the dislocations.

Knee dislocations might be the worst lower body injuries in sports. You can easily have long term nerve or vascular damage and can even lose the leg. Given the choice, I'd rather have the broken bones.",sports
Not fortunate at all. Ligament damage and dislocations are typically much worse than breaks in terms of recovery/return to form.,sports

Not the same shot. Meaning he got hit in the head at least 2x. In first shot he is looking to the right when ball hits. In second shot he is looking straight forward. Also in first shot ball bounces off his head into his arms then the ground. Second shot goes straight to the ground.

I'm an A's fan, and went to see them face the yankees. yankees were up by 2, 9th inning rolls around, and Mariano Rivera is in. He quickly gets 2 outs. Then, we get a single and a walk.

The batter is Marco Scutaro. And he's batting .050. Absolutely abysmal. And everyone was groaning. Terrible, terrible batting average. And immediately gets 2 strikes, 0-2 count.

And he hits a walk off, foul post hitting 3 run homer off mariano rivera! It was the best thing ever, and I became a humongous Scutaro Fan.

Moral is, I hope Davis turns things around, becomes great again, and serves as a lesson to kids not to give up.

Funny story I always bring up about him, when he came back in the fall of senior year, he broke this kids entire set of wood bats, in 1 at bat. His ball broke into the hands of right handed batters. Cracked 2 of his bats on back to back pitches. He came back out with a 200$ wood bat, the fucking umpire said “oh you better not break that one too!” You bet your ass I called for another fastball inside.

"Where I'm from wood bat tournaments are somewhat common, especially for the high level guys",sports
"For reals. Why would you put yourself at a disadvantage like that if you don’t have to? Metal bats are lighter, faster and hit farther",sports
My entire high school league used wide bats (catholic schools),sports
"A 94 mph fastball reaches home plate in 439 milliseconds. A voluntary blink of the eyes takes about 150 milliseconds. It also takes about 150 milliseconds for a pro baseball player to swing his bat. It takes 75 seconds for the brain to form an image of the baseball flying toward home plate, which gives him a whole 50 milliseconds (1/3 of the time it takes to blink your eyes) to think about whether or not he should swing. If he does want to swing, that swing begins with the ball still 18 feet from home plate. Obviously at 99 mph that timeframe becomes even more compressed.

"Ah, interesting",sports
"Tournaments, yes. He said high school ball. No one would do that. Especially if you're good and competing for a scholarship.",sports
"Eh I knew plenty of guys who did, once you commit to a school there really is no sense to stat pad, and I know a few coaches asked their guys to use wood bats only their senior year.",sports

We had a Marucci when I was in high school that some of the power hitters used as a novelty. We also played wood bat in the summer with the same coach.,sports
had a buddy that woulld use a wood bat because with a metal or composite bat hed hit a home run every hit. gave him a wood so hed hit singles and doubles more often,sports
Like I said it's been 15 years since I was in high school. No one would use that. It didn't do anything for you if you were trying to play college ball.,sports

What's his name? Did he go to college since he can hit a home run every time,sports
"The Andrew McCutchen model. Because wood bats are heavier than composite bats so you need a little more power to swing one. Why wouldn’t you want to hit a wooden bat over the heads of kids from bumfuck nowhere. It’s a novelty.

"Are you shitting on yourself? Not into fulfilling your public self-degradation fantasies but you’re an idiot. I’ve explained this to you 4 different ways so here we go again. 

1) It’s a novelty. Not something you do all the time but when you don’t need to score runs and are literarily just trying to make it to the 6th inning so the game can be called, you have a little leeway for fun.

2) You probably didn’t play wooden bat league in the off season with the same exact team and coach.. We were already a wooden bat team. 

3) I understand that it’s not ideal to swing a wooden bat that’s why the fuck we did it. You don’t swing a composite bat for the rest of your life, eventually you move on to wood. So in that regard it’s good practice for the future and for the summer and it’s a challenge for talented players.

4) Because it’s more difficult to swing a wooden bat you are less likely to score runs - so in situations when you don’t need to score it’s useful. Usually we would just swing for the fence and 9/10 it would end up as a flare. Which is good when you are trying to end the game without taking the other team’s dignity. But it’s also a lot of fun to try and hit homers with a wooden bat.",sports
I mean he didn’t hit one every time but he did hit them very often. He didn’t get a scholarship because his elbow got fucked and he stopped playing his senior year and started smoking pot and shit. So he likely never got big attention because of that. Kid was a beast tho like 6’4 290,sports
Why are you so aggressive,sports
"I will play your game if that is what you want. I can make a list as well.

1. Where I am from it's not a thing nor a novelty. I'm sorry thats not what my coaches ever taught me. 

2. I didn't play wooden bat league. Once again I'm sorry where I grew up we didn't have that. 

3. I'm sorry that you had to swing wooden bats. That's not how I played high school ball. I understand the reason * of using it to get in the league but when I was in high school,  since college used composite bats. 

4. I never once have claimed it's not harder to hit a wooden bat. Why don't you go re read what I said throughout this thread.

"He was like shit, I hit it!!! Lol",sports
"The best part of this is the freeze for a split second after he lets the bat go, he didn't realize he made contact until he saw the infielders running back.",sports
Would be the Buccos that miss it.,sports
"Shouldn't he have left the ball though and get a ball? In cricket, the batting coaches will tell you to read what the bowler is bowling from his hand (i.e. the way he grips the ball). Is it not the same in baseball?",sports

He should have brought a 9 iron to the plate.,sports

"He ain't called El Mago just because he can do the quarter trick, folks. The man is uncanny at making things happen and this is proof of that.",sports
Meanwhile Chris Davis just set the MLB record for most at bats without a hit. Maybe he should try this.,sports
Chris Davis has gotta be like WTF?!?!,sports
Seems kind of dangerous for the rules to allow a batter to throw his bat at the ball.,sports
"is he, uh, allowed to do that?",sports
More like an error by Pittsburgh.,sports

I got kicked out of a little league game when I was a kid for doing this. I thought throwing the bat while in the box was illegal.,sports
This thread is so tamed compared to the cricket thread from yesterday. People on this thread is gladly informing each other without ripping them apart for not knowing whats going on.,sports

That is just not cricket.,sports
"You don't see a lot of firsts in baseball, but I'm pretty sure that's a first.",sports
Is this considered an error by the shortstop? Or is the angle of the camera making it seem closer than it actually is?,sports

So for a baseball fan from afar... RBI??,sports
What's that thing on his thumb?,sports
call that a ground rule single,sports
That Shrug would make a good reaction GIF.,sports
That's why they call him El Mago...,sports
the fuckery that baseball can be sometimes....,sports
I mean if Kevin Newman is any good this is an out.,sports
Baez can do this but Chris Davis can’t even get a line drive to find some grass.,sports
That is a scorching line drive through the 5-6 hole in the book.,sports
"How many guys in the MLB can do that?  He got totally fooled by the breaking ball, but his wrists are so damn strong he can change his angle mid-swing.  Thats fucking wild, he must have Dan Uggla forearms",sports
"Quick, someone post this video on Chris Davis' Instagram, Twitter or Facebook page. Just sayin'.",sports
"Nice work, Bucs.",sports
What's that thing on his thumb?,sports
That was unexpected,sports

"As a Cubs fan, Javy's silly things like this are the only thing keeping me entertained.",sports
What a crazy season.,sports
Why is my flair basketball,sports
I've been a huge Javy fan since he first arrived in Chicago! Hands down he's been the most electrifying player in the league the last couple of years. You never know what sort of spectacular play you'll get out of him. You can tell he truly loves the game of baseball and I hope he has a long and prosperous Hall of Fame career with the Cubs.,sports
Chris Davis cried when he saw this,sports
"Javier Baez could be a character in a baseball comedy movie like ""Major League"". He's a great defender but also a whacky guy that frustrates his coach by swinging at pitches way outside the strike zone. Here he gets a hit by letting the bat fly out of his hands rather than holding onto it as the pitch reaches him.",sports
How did the pitcher actually execute that yorker?,sports
Is such low ball throwing allowed ? How was the batter supposed to hit a ball that didn't even reach him,sports
This is why baseball can be so frustrating. You can hit a line drive pisser that is right to the guy for an out and then do something like this for an RBI single.,sports
"I don't know much about baseball, but under what circumstances would it be called a foul for a pitcher? ( Like the ball being thrown very badly or something)",sports
Oh wow... I'd forgotten that baseball existed,sports

Throwing the bat is a bad strategy for obvious reasons, and an umpire has authority to rule on anything not explicitly covered in the rules (like throwing a bat at a ball) but in general an honest attempt to bat a ball that results in a slipped bat isn't going to ruffle any pro ump feathers.",sports
came to say the same thing.  i thought you cant do that,sports
I came here to say the same thing.  I thought that should be an out.  Though live it was probably to fast to tell.,sports

What I, as a fan, would like to see is protection for pitchers from come-backers. I'm horrified when a pitcher takes a line drive to the head. I saw this product pitched on Dragon's Den a while ago, seems like it would be good: https://www.ballcapliner.com/",sports
"It's American baseball. The pitch from the team on defense was outside the strike zone. But the batter still swung at the pitch any way. Normally when you hit a baseball with a bat you hold onto the bat through the whole swing and follow through. Here, the batter Baez was able to hit the ball even though the pitch was far away with him because the Bat slips out of his hands.",sports
Haha I was hoping I'd see something like this. Did not disappoint.,sports
I see what you did there.,sports
?? How difficult is it to comprehend? It's literally in the title.,sports
Just watched this last night .  Never gets old,sports
"He didn't just dig it out, he managed to chip it over wide mid-on for a single/couple.",sports
"It was mentioned above, but the Cubs were running what's called a ""hit and run"". The runner on first base takes off running as soon as the pitcher starts his delivery, and the batter *must* make contact with the ball no matter what. Otherwise the runner will almost certainly be caught stealing second base. So yes, normally any batter (even a swing-happy Baez) would not swing at that pitch, but Baez was forced to. 

They signal this play from the [third base coach](http://m.mlb.com/glossary/positions/third-base-coach), who is able to communicate using signals between the manager in the dugout, the batter, and the men on base to call for steals, bunts, the hit-and-run, and other plays. The pitcher and catcher use their own set of signals to call pitches. Fun fact: ""stealing signs"", or figuring out what the other team's signals mean, isn't against the rules. A team will occasionally have to change signs around to prevent the other team from knowing what's about to happen. (edit: stealing the catcher's signs to the pitcher is considered extremely bad sportsmanship and may get you thrown at intentionally). 

Most people don't see any of this stuff going on between pitches, so it looks like a whole lot of nothing happening. In reality, there's lots of strategy on the part of both teams between pitches.",sports
Javy Baez (the subject of the gif) swings at everything. Absolutely everything.,sports
"You’re right, he should not have swung. However this player has a habit of swinging at everything. It helps that he’s incredibly talented, but he does have a bad habit. It worked out for him here.",sports
"The shortstop had 3 errors, the third basemen had 1 error, and the pitcher took a line drive to the head all in that half inning.",sports
"Yeah, I'm surprised there isn't a rule against it (not that I'd want one).  Baseball's such a weird game.",sports
I was gonna ask the same question.. someone answer this guy,sports
"Yes, he is.",sports
when the thrown bat interferes with a player attempting to field the batted ball.  It's the umpire's judgement as to whether that interference occurred.,sports
"It seems that any bat throwing is against the rules in little league, but this situation is not covered under any other ruleset, except within an  interference ruling.",sports
"Lol most of the comments on the cricket thread are either trolling the sport or going ""I'll never be able to understand the sport"", despite cricket front paging quite often. Genuine queries are answered, cricket fans are tired of the trolling/flaunting their ignorance comments.",sports
I’m pretty sure I’ve seen footage of Ichiro hitting a single off a ball in the dirt. He didn’t let go of the bat though.,sports
"Nope, [Todd Frazier hit a home run this way a few years ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf0rSNyRPJw)",sports
"They didn’t call it an error, it actually would have been a pretty nice play had he caught that.  Still, a play that a lot of shortstops in the league would have made. This guy had a horrible game with several errors.",sports
No they do that all the time. Maybe if they throw it in aggression or something it could be.,sports
RBI= Run batted In. So the pitcher threw a really low pitch that the batter really didn't need to swing at...but he actually kinda swung/tossed his bat it anyway....which is pretty funny (not really how you do it lol). So because of that awkward hit he got on base and his teammate that already was on a base ran home to score a run (point).,sports
"Run Batted In, when a run is scored from a hit",sports
"It's a little rubber pad that fits between the bat and the ""curvy bit"" between your thumb and index finger.

In theory, it keeps the bat away from the palm of your hand, loosening your grip, which then speeds up your swing.",sports
"The running gag, he is second in the league in AVG with some of the most ridiculous hits ever

His OBP/OPS suffers",sports
"If the batter swings and misses its a strike. 3 strikes and you are out, so many pitchers will intentionally throw pitches that are outside of the “strike zone” in an attempt to fool batters into swinging at pitches they have no chance at hitting

On the other hand, if the batter doesn’t swing at a pitch outside of the strike zone, the home plate umpire can rule the pitch a Ball. 4 balls in an at bat result in a walk, a free pass for the batter to go to 1st base.

So to answer your question, yes these throws are allowed, but with some potential downsides for the pitcher",sports
"So the pitcher throws the ball at the batter. If it is in the strike zone and the batter doesn't hit it, it's a strike. But if it's outside the strike zone it's a Ball, which is bad for the pitcher and good for the batter because 4 balls in an at bat is penalized with a free base. If the pitch is a ball but the batter swings and misses it is a strike, so it is a big risk to swing at outside pitches.

But no matter how bad the pitch is, if the batter manages to hit it, it still counts as you hitting the pitch. In this case the ball was so far outside the strike zone that the batter Baez probably wouldn't have been able to reach it if the bat had not gone flying out of his hand.

Sometimes the pitch is so bad that it will bounce off the ground before it reaches the batter. It's a ball if the batter doesn't swing because the pitcher threw a bad pitch. BUT the batter can still swing at it for a strike or a hit if he wants.",sports
It would be a 'ball' if it's not thrown in the batter's strike zone...ie in this situation...so he really didn't have to swing at that but did anyway lol,sports
What did they do to you?,sports
The M's are just setting me up for heartbreak. I can feel it.,sports
I feel like there's been a lot of home runs but I have no stats to back that up.,sports

"Yeah, but he doesn’t walk a ton and his obp could be improved a ton with some more discipline. His War suffers a bit currently.",sports
"I haven't followed baseball in years, but isn't .290 fairly average? I thought the good players bat in the 300s

That's a lot of HRs though so I guess this guy just tries to hit home runs every time.",sports
"You're gonna hate what they're cooking up in Toronto, then!",sports
I think the key issue is if you did it on purpose.  You are not supposed to be able to throw your bat at the ball.,sports
"Yes, that's the idea. Did this rule change? I was always told losing hold of your bat while at the plate is an automatic out.",sports
"It's an official rule, but the context is a little different. You can't throw the bat at a fielder trying to make a play.",sports
I was gonna say nah...then I remembered that a 400 foot fence is only 133 yards. I'm terrible at golf but I can consistently hit a PW for 120. The pros are definitely able to clear the fence with a pitching wedge.,sports
"Yes.  Saw another comment that said ""This guy will swing at anything.""  That isn't what happened here.  BTW, for those of you who don't know baseball, a Hit and Run is when a baserunner starts running during the pitch.  He is relying on the batter to make contact with the ball so he doesn't get thrown out.  If the batter gets a hit, he has a head start on the base running and might make it all the way home from first base for a run, which is what happened here.  If the batter hits it foul, he goes back to first and they try it again on the next pitch.  If the batter misses the ball, most likely he gets thrown out at second base by the catcher.  So, the batter literally has to swing at the pitch, no matter how bad it is.  It's a designed play.",sports
"That’s because there was a man at 3rd already who got to home base? Also, would that count as a drop catch, and therefore not towards Baez’s average?

What does RBI stand for?,sports
"If the pitcher throws ball out of range for the batter to hit and the batter hits it anyways, can he still run to first base?",sports
i dont know cricket,sports
They could be blind,sports
There is no rule against throwing your bat at a pitch in an attempt to get a hit. You can get called for interference if it hampers fielders attempt to get the ball. It is up to the umpire. Repeated bat throwings can get you ejected however.,sports
Its more like cricket fans on reddit have a massive inferiority complex when it comes to baseball.,sports
I once saw Shohei Ohtani do the same. I wonder if this is more common in Japan.,sports
"Oh, so it was just a silly shot for a professional player. Okay thank you.",sports
Isn’t that what usually happens?? Runs are scored from the batter hitting the ball?,sports
"It's a good thing Babe Ruth used this, otherwise he wouldn't of had all those home runs!",sports
I saw the ball hitting the ground before it hit the bat. Does that mean an outfielder can still catch it?  Does hitting the ground has to be after its hit or after its thrown?,sports
Thanks dude,sports

"Yeah true. but when that lineup is healthy they don't really need that out of him. He's not a guy who can consistently carry an offense, he can in spurts, but that's really not the type of hitter he is, he's a free swinger and when that lineup is healthy like I said, he makes them extremely dangerous in the 4 spot. The Cubs problem so far isn't hitting, they may be the best offense in the N.L., that pitching staff though has had some major issues so far. Javys job isn't to draw walks, his job is to get runners home. Say man on third one out, his job really isn't to draw a walk to increase his OBP, his job is to get that guy home and you do that by making contact. I'd rather have him be a free swinger and get those guys home, than tinker with him and have him up there drawing walks not swinging.",sports

Can’t remember the player, maybe Vlad Guerrero but when asked why he didn’t walk more he said “you don’t walk off the island...you hit your way off the island” iow scouts coming to see prospects aren’t watching plate discipline as much as someone hammering it.  I believe Baez is PR so that’s an island.  So that maybe works.",sports
"Hes not a robot and he doesn’t play the game to attain the highest war possible. If you try to change a player like Baez (to try and take more walks, for example) it’s gonna fuck with his mojo and ruin him as a player",sports
"No, don’t cook him!",sports
"I honestly dont think MLB cares, because 99% of the time, if a player did this, it would result in a swing and a miss, and even if they DO make contact, the chances of getting an actual hit is rare (hence why a video like this is amazing to watch).

They just dont want them using bats as weapons, so if the act happens in the natural course of a swing at a ball, they just let it slide.",sports

That's...not even remotely what happened here. There were runners at first and third at the beginning of the play. The runner on third scored on Baez's single, and the runner on first moved to second.",sports
"Yeah there was a runner at 3rd who made it home. There wasn't a drop, it just kind of blooped in so that wouldn't be considered an error. Normally for an error to happen on a fly ball one of the defenders has to physically drop it. You are correct though that errors would be counted as an out for the purpose of batting average.",sports
"Indian living in California, here. Unlike test cricket I've yet to grasp the nuances of baseball.

Also, what's a drop catch?",sports
"Fun fact: you can get an RBI without even swinging the bat, if you are walked with bases loaded.",sports
"Runs batted in. That means the amount of times the team scores a run off your hit. Since the player on third advanced to home, Baez got 1 RBI off of a single (hit to first base). A home run is also 1 RBI, unless more people are on base, in which case its how many people score.",sports
"Runs Batted In. Because Baez got a hit (in this case, a silly hit) his teammate was able to score. In the stats, his teammate gets one ""run"" for scoring and Baez gets one RBI for helping him score. Sort of like an Assist in other sports.",sports

"Old Cubs fan here.  I know your pain.  The Cubs had a great thing going in 1969- Billy Williams, Ernie Banks, Ron Santo, Ferguson Jenkins, Leo Durocher (5 Hall of Famers).  When Ken Holtzman threw a no-hitter on August 19 the Cubs led the division by 8-1/2 games.  It turned at to be a breakthrough year . . . for the Mets.

>Hoping to improve on the previous year's 84–78 record, the Cubs began the 1969 season by winning 11 of their first 12 games, and on August 16, they were 75–44, up by a season high nine games over second place New York. By September 2, they had soared to an 84–52 record, well on pace to exceed the previous season's mark, but their lead over the Mets had fallen to five games. From there the Mets went on a tear. The Cubs ultimately lost 17 of the last 25 games of the season, while the Mets went 23–7 to overtake the Cubs and finish eight games ahead of them. It was one of the most astounding late season collapses in history, with the seventeen-game turnaround being one of the biggest ever. The Cubs finished 92–70, while the Mets won the National League East and would go on to win the World Series.",sports

"Naw, I was asking for the pros. Thank you.

Is there a reason for that rule?",sports
Your argument here is basically that he doesn't need to be better if other players are better instead. Which is as true of Baez as it is of any player on any team.,sports
"Yeah, he was 2nd behind Yelich in MVP voting last year. As a Cubs fan, most of us love him for his defensive skills alone, his bat is just an added bonus.",sports
"Maybe, what does it take away though if he drew more walks? Meaning say 3 and 2 he swings at a ball a little outside and hits a 2 RBI double, instead of taking ball 4 for a walk. So you kind of have to take the good with the bad. It's hard to say if he walked more he'd be better, because a lot of his success is due to him being a free swinger.",sports
"I think people are missing something, he hit the ball while the bat is in his hand. Then the bat comes out of his hand a milisecond after the hit.

Otherwise he wouldn't be able to hit that distance anyway.",sports
"Heh, let it slide",sports
"> Putter? 120 yards.

[It's been done](https://youtu.be/MVuOwzFGaj8?t=46)",sports
"Cool. Thanks for the explanations. I wondered how the error rule would apply here as it looked like it should have been a catch, just everyone has a WTF moment that delayed his response. Curious if an error can be applied even if the fielder doesn’t touch it.",sports
"I understand completely. I learned the basics of cricket over the past year or so by watching YouTube videos, but the detail and intricacies in r/cricket are still baffling to me!",sports
"Dont worry too much, baseball has so many rules that cover virtually any scenario, that even MLB players sometimes forget what rule applies in certain situations, and they mess up too. There are also plenty of heads up, or ""baseball IQ"" plays where smart players remember obscure rules to their advantage in a situation.",sports
"Yeah, didn’t notice that first time around. 

Drop catch is when the fielder should have caught it but dropped it, and can be either dropped after touch, or didn’t attempt the catch but should have. I guess a fielding error would be a synonym here in baseball, but didn’t know if “not getting there but should have” counts as an error.",sports
Cheers! As an Englishman my knowledge of baseball is pretty much zero.,sports
It’s a joke.,sports
"It's kind of a grey area. The umpire can ask you to stop throwing the bat, and refusal gives you an ejection, regardless of the other rules. I more was referring to the ball is fair and there is no automatic out or foul ball off of throwing the bat. It is also very hard to do repeatedly, so you will be sacrificing hits, or taking strikes on bad pitches if youdo this.",sports
"> I really want to see it in **slower** slow motion

"Yeah for me, and I’m sure a lot of players, it just comes down to a comfort thing. And that’s so funny about your team. Man I would love to coach one day",sports
Golf clubs do this at any age if you hit it just wrong. Stings like a motherfucker.,sports
"Pitchers would die, mostly. And outfields would need to expand at least ~30%.",sports
Because the baseball would be going to orbit every hit.,sports
You can crush a ball with a metal bat.  Allowing pros to use them would amplify homeruns.,sports
"Tradition and player safety, generally.  MLB players using metal bats would be putting the infielders and especially the pitchers in a shooting gallery.  MLB batters routinely club the ball over 100 mph as it is with wood bats and it's not uncommon for a pitcher to get injured on a hard line drive coming back at them because there's almost no time to react when it happens.",sports
"I think it had to do with tradition but mostly safety.  Iirc, there was a study on ball speeds off the bat and the metal bats were off the charts vs wood",sports
Part of it is due to safety. Aluminum bats weigh almost nothing compared to wooden so you get a lot faster swing and greater distance out of each hit.,sports
Metal bats return the ball with way more force than a wood bat. The number of homers would go through the roof,sports
"tradition maybe? but also if the pros got to use metal, every ball would be scared for its life and the mlb would lose too much money as the number of homers increases astronomically",sports
"Yes, but every hitter on every other team is not capable of mashing 34 dingers.  He is also a dynamo on the basepaths.  I would LOOOOOVE if he drew more walks, but there is a part of me that thinks that might break him.  He is an all-or-nothing guy.  If he loses that mentality, what else would he lose?  I'm not sure, but tinkering with what ain't broke might just break it.",sports
"That's not my argument at all. Why would drawing walks make him better? Let's look at harper, a guy who walks a ton, Harper's only drove in 100 runs once in his career, was last year and was 100 even. Would it help his team if harper swung more to drive in runs, or is he just fine sitting up there taking walks?",sports
"You can say that again haha. I’m a die hard Cubs fan too man, born on a northern suburb, just didn’t feel the need to interject that into my statement responding to that guy. Love me some Javy though. Fantastic to see Schwarbs mashing early on here too",sports
"If he's taking more walks (and fewer strikeouts) then theoretically he's going to be swinging at more pitches in the strike zone, which would increase slugging, especially for a hitter like Baez.  He still chases too much so pitchers aren't going to be forced to challenge him with strikes.  And with the Cubs lineup it's pretty hard to pitch around that, you have Bryant, Rizzo, Schwarber, Zobrist (led the team in OBP, good for 8th in the NL).",sports
"Yea, he just lost control of the bat after he hit the ball.  I don’t really understand how this is note worthy.",sports
it can be but often is not,sports
"The rule of thumb for an error in baseball is ""had the fielder played the ball/made the throw routinely, an out would have been made"".

No one could have made an out on this play short of a super-superhuman effort. Even if a fielder has gotten a glove on this, then dropped it, it's unlikely to be ruled as an error.",sports
"> Curious if an error can be applied even if the fielder doesn’t touch it.

Yes, it can, but not usually for pop-ups. A common no-touch error is when a ground ball slips right between a players legs while they have their glove down, but they just completely miss the ball entirely.",sports
"Intricacies like nature of the surface and stuff like that, or the inside jokes and memes?",sports
"If a play should have been made, the scorer will usually rule it an error. In this case, that would have been a pretty spectacular catch, and errors aren't usually given on plays where the defender has his back to the infield. Especially by the home scorer, since an error would count as an at bat but not a hit, and so would actually lower his batting average.",sports
"I mean, drop catch isn't a real thing in baseball. So there's that.",sports
"Lol sure. "" I was only acting retarded""",sports
Well ya this is true. Pretty interesting tho. I never knew that rule. Baseball has some odd hidden rules,sports
"Yeah, but if want to make a shitty post you should probably make sure your grammar isn't going full retard.",sports
"Yeah man, it’s the best part of my week when we practice or play a tournament.

"The current iteration of legal, metal bats are actually very similar to wood bats now (easier for scouts, safer). I personally preferred wood over most metal bats when it came to power, as did many others which you would have never heard of with the previous iteration of metal bats.

"One time when messing around after practice my dad decided to pitch some golf balls to my brother and I, I was probably in 6th grade or so, we didn’t quite get them to orbit but we did blow holes in the wooden advertisements along the back fence.",sports

"I dread the day an MLB pitcher is killed. Any single pitch, it's really unlikely, but so many pitches are thrown per season . . .",sports

"Tradition is one large part. Unlike most pro sports, Baseball is heavily driven by statistics, and they can compare players today to players like Babe Ruth or Ted Williams, because much of the game has not changed very much. A "".300 hitter"" means just as much today as it did in 1930, for example.",sports
"I don't disagree with the premise at all, but, he's a .290 hitter who led the league in RBI's last year, does he strike out too much? Sure, but does chasing pitches sometimes seem to work out for him? Yes, as this video even proves. What was it runner on first and  third and 2 out? Did he swing at a terrible pitch? Of course, did he have an RBI single from swinging at a terrible pitch? Yes. What was more effective? Taking the walk, or swinging at a pitch he had no business swinging at?",sports
"Mostly trying to keep up with the stats and names. I have a tenuous grasp at least on the big names for the national Test team players, but when IPL or BBL or another domestic league is in the conversation I can't keep up. Also, knowing what's good or bad for a stat. If I see that ""So-and-so has a Strike Rate of x.xx"" I don't know what a good strike rate is so there's no context.

"Yes, at least a high quality wood bat, which is what any serious player will be using anyway. The previous iteration of metal bats were ridiculous, in which case my downvotes would be deserved. That's why homerun numbers, especially distributed amongst college teams are way down from previous years using the old metal bats. Much more impressive nowadays to come across a power hitter on a college team as it more closely resembles how they will perform in the minors using wood. Metal bats are certainly a bit more forgiving outside the sweet spot, but a fairly negligible difference when both hit solid.",sports
"A much lesser extent. Pitchers are just closer to the plate, and are immediately put at a disadvantage by being off balance as a result of the follow through of throwing a pitch. All the fielders are expecting the ball to be hit at them and are ready to react accordingly",sports
"Don't disagree. But, in the case of Javy, it's his job to drive in runs. His job isn't to get on base, his job is to get the run across the plate. Would I like to see him be more selective? Of course, but you can't argue results and sometimes you just have to let a player be themselves. It's an old cliche I know, but if he is producing, you got to let Javy be Javy, for good and bad.",sports
"That's fine. I've played Division 1 baseball and professionally and have had extensive experience with both options. Some of us practiced exclusively using wood bats during college. The latest iteration of metal bats were almost indistinguishable from wooden bats if you didn't hear the ball off the bat. As a power hitter myself, I can say that some of my furthest homerun were often with a high quality, wooden bat. 

I completely understand the skepticism though, especially those who aren't taking hundreds of swings a day or who were not exposed to the current iteration of legal, metal bats.",sports
"Im a Cubs fan, so im totally fine letting Javy be Javy, but i was just saying that this trend isnt limited to him, its wide spread in the MLB. Just take Aaron Judge for example, his rookie season he lead the league in HR with 52, but also lead in Ks with 208. With these types of players, you just have to take the good with the bad.",sports

I'm sure there's be new new research if things changed.



>Ball exit velocity (BEV) was measured from 17 experienced baseball hitters using wood and metal bats of similar length and mass but different moments of inertia. This research was conducted in response to safety issues for defensive players related to high BEV from metal baseball bats reported in the literature. Our purpose was to determine whether metal bats, with their lower swing moment of inertia, produce a higher linear bat tip velocity than wooden bats swung by the same players. Analysis using high-speed videography indicated significant differences in the x-component of velocity for both the proximal (metal = 5.4 m s−1; wood = 3.9 m s−1) and distal ends of the bats (metal = 37.2 m s−1; wood = 35.2 m s−1), p < 0.01. The orientation of the bats with respect to the horizontal plane was also significantly more “square” 0.005 s prior to impact (270°) for the metal (264.3°) compared with the wood bat (251.5°), p < 0.01.

*Journal of Applied Biomechanics* v19 n4 283-294",sports
"Some of my 10U kids swing composite/metal bats that SOUND like wood. I thought they were swinging wood bats until I inspected one last fall.  One of them even had a wood grain wrap on it. Off topic, but, we play a few wood bat tournaments every year. Those are always fun. One of the coaches last year tried to snap a bat over his knee Bo Jackson style after it was already cracked and ended up really messing his quad up. Walked with a limp for the rest of the tournament. Good times.",sports
I fully agree.,sports
"That study seemed to be pre-BBCOR. I went off to look for some studies as well and found interesting data. I found studies claiming a 1-2 meters per second faster exit velos on the BBCOR bat vs wood and some studies comparing the BBCOR of a BBCOR bat vs the BBCOR of a wood bat. BBCOR of a BBCOR bat was higher than wood, and of course less than that of the previous BESR bats. Didn't find too much info on the comparisons between quality of wood bat, vs various types of BBCOR bats, which certainly can alter data and even affect my own experiences considering I stuck to a similar aluminum bat most of my college career.

The data I saw definitely shows there is a distinguishable difference at the data level, but how much that affects perception in real-time and the overall travel distance of a batted baseball, I'm not sure. It's definitely not as drastic as some of the comments in here assume, anymore at least. Being into research myself, and having a passion in baseball, a personal study here intrigues me.",sports
"Yeah some of the newer bats sound very strange. I remember the first time I heard those bats rolling out of the bus and we were all wondering why the hell the other team was taking BP with wood before the game. 

And that's a funny story. Often time the bat breaks but it's still extremely sturdy. Never had any teammate willing to take that risk on those types of bats, and for good reason because your thigh will feel it. All the more impressive when I see Bo Jackson breaking non-broken bats like twigs.",sports

"Why are they saying “We want Utley” if they hate him? Confused by that. Also confused why the pitcher was thrown out? Did he make a certain amount of bad throws?

Thanks for the video but now I have more questions",sports
"But there isn’t a zero tolerance policy for warning pitches.  It’s left up to the umps discretion but if his consideration was “if this happens then he’s out” could have easily been addressed and warned prior to the play or before the game.  He enacted a zero tolerance policy without informing anyone.  Which is within his rights but it doesn’t make the players objections invalid.
Such a soft pitch  behind him is a threat but not an uncommon one in baseball.  This one is actually way less dangerous than a brushback which is very common.",sports
"Syndergaard easily could have fed Utley a high inside fastball or straight up beaned him, but instead he threw a low effort, low ball two feet behind him. Not a cordial action, but getting thrown out for such a low risk pitch? Come on.",sports
Exactly this. Baseball has this weird notion of allowing players to deliberately try and hurt each other as retribution for other perceived slights. It's idiotic.,sports
"They want Utley to pay for what he did, not physically want him on their team.

Pitcher was thrown out because he intetionally threw at Utley.  It wasnt just a bad throw or a mistake.  Utley knew it was coming I am guessing.  I dont think he should have been thrown without a warning, ump should have told the pitcher before game ""watch yourself with Utley. This is your warning"".  Let Noah decide if he is willing to be thrown out for it(he probably still throws at Utley anyways out of respect).  Pitchers throwing at people who disrespect teammates is incredibly common.  Generally first time in game you get a warning.",sports

"They are playing by the rules. HBP or throw-behind isn't an automatic ejection, the rules say it's up to the ump. 

Do you seriously not understand why, if umps are planning to be uncommonly Draconian because of perceived or real tensions, players might want to know that before someone gets ejected for something that wouldn't have been an ejection the day before?",sports
"Well... Yes.  When it’s standard to give a warning first in initial incident it would be good to inform them that you have predetermined to have zero tolerance.  Especially when it comes from such a harmless pitch as this, ps the pitch looks a lot closer to him than it really was.
To use your example that you say elsewhere the maximum you can be fined for speeding is $1000, should everyone caught speeding pay $1000.  How often is the harshest punishment given in the first incident?",sports
Let’s use another legal differentiation.  Threatening someone vs hitting someone which are legally two different levels of crime with different levels of punishment.  Under zero tolerance there’s no measure of nuance to dealing with the situation.,sports

1) with Texas Tech up 3 and looking for a stop to potentially make it a two possession game with under 3 minutes left, kyle Guy clearly trips on his own player, but they call a foul on Texas Tech. They did not show a replay. He drained both free throws.

2) Texas Tech has a fast break to tie the game with a minute left, Kyle Guy blatantly fouls him and then they somehow decide this is UVA’s ball:

That was ridiculous. Not to mention Guy slapped him right before that.   I guess they didn’t see that though.  I didn’t really care who won but it seems like Virginia got a lot of sweetheart calls this tournament.  Especially right at the end of the games.,sports

Fucking thank you. Should have been our ball. Should have been our game,sports
I believe that was the refs attempt at undoing their terrible call earlier when the ball went out off the backhand of a TT player. Balancing missed calls usually looks bad to both sides,sports

There was one incredibly bad call and that's when Virginia was down in the last part of the game, and guy was taking the ball the the hoop, and was tripped BY HIS OWN TEAM MATE, AND THE REFS GAVE HIM 2 FREE THROWS.   


That's the exact moment Texas went from winning the game to losing the game.   


Then they call replays for simple possession of ball and zoom in with a camera to see what player it went off for out of bounds?

Then the no call on that fast break, where they stopped to double check to see if it grazed his hand, happened. If those calls happen in the flow of regulation, they might get balanced out, but those two shitty sequences in the last few minutes really screwed Texas tech out of a chance to win or lose based on their play.

"I disagree. I was at the game and that stadium was a TT home crowd. No momentum was lost. They still got up by 3 and made a bad play for the 5th time that game by letting Hunter be free on the right corner. The reason he was opem was because Guy burned them on the left side doing the same thing 4x. They should've drawn the foul or allowed the layup.

Not to mention Culver had 2 UGLY 3 attempts in the last seconds. Mooney and Maretta were HOT. Mooney should've had that last shot in regulation. He swished that same shot in OT right away.",sports

"I think a good question to bring into play too is at what point is a time out actually signaled? Is it when the player begins the motion or when one hand makes contact with another one? I would think it would be the latter solely because it is a more intentional motion. 

Also I think it is important to note that I am an Auburn fan and ever since the no call on the double dribble in the semi-finals I have turned spiteful against the officiating. Not saying UVA’s championship is undeserved but I cant bring up UVA winning with at least putting an asterisk next to the officiating.",sports

"I'd be okay with calling it redemption. They regained the respect of CBB after being a laughingstock from the loss. It was not, however, a comeback story or turnaround story.",sports

"Been hearing a lot about him, but the only TT games I've seen were the last 2, so I was very underwhelmed finally getting to see him lol. He did finish Saturday's game with a nice little run, though.",sports
"Totally true! I was thinking the same thing when they were showing the replay, but I hate that they can’t retroactively call a foul. I think that’s the worst part of replays, only certain things can be changed by replay and not others.",sports
Him not changing the trajectory does not matter. All that matters is whether he was touching it. It does matter during the whole game but there’s special emphasis at the end in a close game to try and get each possession call correct.,sports
"...or perhaps a player tripping over his teammate and getting free throws out of it is the most obvious and egregiously bad call, and gets a lot of attention because of that?",sports
"Foul calls can’t be reviewed. Only for out of bounds, time check, and hits to the head",sports
Hit his hand last. Yea he rules are wacky and need to be changed but right now the rule is who touched it last made it go out.,sports

You obviously don't understand that rule.  There was no possession at the time.  The tip did not establish possession.  Possession was finally established for the first time when Clark recovered the ball in the backcourt.  Visa vie no backcourt violation.

>They missed a double dribble that handed the the victory against Auburn.

They missed a foul on ~~Purdue~~ Auburn at the same time.  No selective vision please.

>They missed a Virginia player grabbing the arm of a TT player allowing the out of bounds play to happen

He did not grab the arm.  Please look at that replay again.  He reached in for a loose ball ( no one established possession yet).

>fucked the game by chainring that out of bounds call.

They corrected the incorrect call on the floor via replay.  So you are complaining about them getting the call correct this time?",sports

The Virginia guy knocked the ball out of bounds...,sports
"Go watch the replay. I rewound and paused when guy called for the timeout.  Ball was clearly in hunters possession. But you know what, it was a split second decision where the ref had to make a judgement call. Just like the missed reach in. Refs aren't perfect and mistakes are made. Cant really argue UVA wasnt the better team either. Had two separate 10 point leads and ultimately TT made SEVERAL of their own mistakes that cost them the game.",sports
What I didnt like about that is they didnt replay it at all. They did however replay the previous shot by Texas tech from 3 different angles.,sports
"Two sides to the coin bud but I doubt you’ve watched much basketball and only came on these threads to bitch and moan. Virginia got dicked on a ton of non-calls and calls this tournament. They just capitalized on the ones that went their way and won those games. All that anyone will remember in five years time is that banner. 

Go cry in a corner until you can come back next year and bitch about those bad referees ruining another tournament.",sports
You’re a Virginia fan in here rubbing it in people’s face on an internet message board instead of celebrating. Take your own advice you fucking loser,sports

Oof. That's a hike.,sports
And you can easily see it roll off of the Texas Tech players hand,sports
"The replay clearly showed the ball was last touched by TT, and if you can't see that you need to look at the same replay the refs, the announcers, and the majority of people saw.   Thats the rule plain and simple.  Think of it as a guy trying to save a ball going out of bounds and purposely throwing it off a guys shins at the end line.  Sure the first players action caused the ball to go out of bounds but it was last touched by the second player.  Thats the game.",sports
"Unfortunately, timeouts aren't reviewable in that sense, as far as I know. They have to be ""acknowledged"" by the ref in real time. And I don't think *anyone* could have 100% correctly made that call in real time. It certainly looked like they lost the ball to me, and the ref needs to watch the ball, not Kyle Guy.

Personally, I think it's silly and they should change the rule. At least make it reviewable.

Honestly, coaches could just have a button to push that either triggers a TO directly, or buzzes the ref to do so. And then no one would ever call a TO when they didn't have one, because it just wouldn't work. And it would add a little fun to the game watching a coach playing jeopardy.

The whole timeout controversy in both basketball and American football is completely unnecessary and doesn't add anything to the actual game.",sports
bc it was egregious.  It wasn't a replay the announcers could ehhhhhhhhhhhh idk jim could be either way.  It was fucking obvious. But there was also nothing they could do about it bc that is not reviewable.  Best to just not show it at all.  Except we all have the internet and now everyone sees it.  It was a fucked situation bc a dumb ass ref had an itchy whistle,sports
"Why do you think I haven't watched basketball? I'm sure I know more than you, and even if I didn't, you're being a pretentious ass for no reason. Literally no one here was being rude, then you come along.

It doesn't matter how much refs messed up against any team; the point is that Virginia was literally given the Auburn game, and that's unacceptable. Refs making more mistakes doesn't fix anything.Therefore, this championship wasn't deserved. 

Grow the fuck up and stop being rude for no reason. It's pathetic.",sports

and my point is that more egregious and obvious missed calls are naturally going to garner more attention and complaint than smaller less obvious missed calls that happen all throughout every game. can you name any other calls in the game that were as egregious? of course thats gonna be the one everyones talking about.,sports
"Nobody would be playing without the refs.  NCAA rules dictate that refs are necessary for official games.

UVa also wouldn't have been playing if they couldn't make buckets in the final seconds of tournament games, which they did in the elite eight, final four, and then again last night in the championiship.",sports
This is just plain false.,sports
"Which you only remember because UVa made the shots to tie or win in the closing seconds.  Had they not made those shots, UVa fans could go back and find other missed/botched calls that did not go in their favor.

Is this your first rodeo?",sports
The no call on the foul on Jerome in the last seconds of the Purdue game did not favor virginia at the time.  The foul would have put him on the line to score the [potentially] tieing points.  So come again?,sports
Glad I could help you with YOUR grammar.,sports
"Grew up a Tennessee fan and haven't been active on this sub in a few years haha, I'll switch it to UVA later",sports
"Yes according to the rule it’s the right call but at any other time of the game it is Tech’s ball, no question about it. The Virginia players weren’t even arguing it was off Tech",sports
"I wouldn't call it ""easily."" I thought it was not enough to overturn it as it left his pinky and the other guy's index finger virtually at the same time but alas.",sports
"I bet if every out of bounds play was replayed, at least 50 percent of them go off the offensive player, but nobody complains because it’s usually the defensive player that causes the ball to go out of bounds. It ruins the spirit of the sport",sports
Also the virginias shit eating grin when he got to shoot 2 when he shouldnt have been,sports
"Virginia got hacked on two back to back baskets within the last 4 minutes of the Auburn game. No calls. Jerome gets hacked on a no call and then picks up a frustration fourth which allows auburn to get back into the game. Your favorite double dribble to bring up shouldn’t have even mattered if they call the foul on Jerome. 

And funny when you are calling me rude when you are the one calling me a pretentious ass after I’m calling you out for talking bullshit in this thread about the team that played hard and played through adversity and won a championship.",sports
"Not a tech fan at all. Haven’t complained about the outcome of the game once. I really thought reading comprehension would be stronger w the Virginia fan base. The guy went into a post game thread to shit on people. That makes him a loser. If you agree with him, congrats on also being a loser.",sports
Case in point. Guys a fucking nerd,sports
So you don’t talk about it.. easy as that. I can name multiple fouls or non calls that helped  TT out.,sports
"lmao so just ignore the literally obvious double dribble that should have ended their run. 

Its ok to acknowledge it mate. its ok, they will still have the trophy",sports
"so if that obvious double dribble had been correctly called at the end of the semi final game, would UVA be in last nights game?  hmmmm",sports
Nope. Been closely following college basketball for half my life. Missing a double dribble or lane violation is different than a foul call. Fouling is partially subjective whereas the other two are clear cut,sports
I’m talking about the over and back and lane violation on the last play of regulation. Should have been Purdue’s ball if either of them were called,sports
pls continue your virtuous mission given to you by your god all across reddit.  Make it the land of proper grammar that you see when you close your eyes at night.,sports
"Responded to the other guy with this but still. 

So, had the va player hit the ball down and it bounced off the tech player visibly and plainly and went out it would still be va ball. It wouldn’t have even been a question. 

Arguing the scale at which the rule should get implemented is silly imo",sports
"Yeh, I kind of had an issue with that too. The replay, while it did touch the TT player last, at any other time in history or during the game (when replay is not available) it goes back to the offense. It kind of took the spirit out of the game.",sports
"If you watch the replay, there’s a good foot between the Va player’s hand and the ball while the other one’s pinky is still bent back from touching it.",sports
"What the hell? Spirit of the sport? They have been doing booth reviews on calls in the last 2mins and overtime for years now. How do you justify the wrong call being made because of the 'spirit of the game.' Is that a joke? Did you see the TT players or coach complaining after they switched the call? No, because everyone could see it went off the TT player last. How about the integrity of the game does that matter to you?",sports
"I am not a fan of the current replay rules either.  But for now the rules are the rules.  If under 2 min they review it.  In this case the review just happened to be clear.  You may not be happy with the result but those are the rules as they stand.

Rules may eventually be changed but as they are now the refs made the correct call.",sports
"Can you please show me where a foul call was missed? I watched the game, everything was pretty smooth until the final seconds.

You were gatekeeping and insulted my basketball knowledge, then said I was ""bitching and moaning."" I don't know about you, but that's not typically something you say to people unless you're being rude.",sports
This dude is so fucking mad and its hilarious.,sports
"I'm beginning to suspect that you actually bet money on the game, lost, and now are seething with bitter anger at those of us who knew better.

Sorry for your many losses!!!",sports
"What about the non-called foul mere seconds before the double dribble?  I mean, the double dribble never would have happened if the refs called that foul against Auburn.

Give it up.  No one saw the double dribble in real-time, just like no one called the foul seconds before.",sports
"So if that obvious foul from the jersey grab before the double would have been correctly called, the double dribble wouldn't have mattered and UVa would still be in last night's game.",sports
"Auburn fouled the UVa dribbler seconds prior to the ""double dribble"", so the ""double dribble"" never gets called, UVa still has the ball and still wins.

Trying to claim that you start criticizing the refs at a definite point in time and ignore all the time before that point is childish.",sports
"How long is half your life?  I'm talking about your first rodeo in regards to confirmation bias.

You believe the game is rigged and then you go out and find evidence confirming your belief.  You ignore or discount contrary evidence, not because that evidence isn't valid, but because that evidence contradicts your belief.

You are left where you started, believing your beliefs, so you feel good, which your brain interprets as further confirmation that you must be ""right"".",sports
"I am talking about the same play.  It was not over and back.  In order to have a backcourt violation the offensive team must have had possession, which per the rules they did not off of the free throw.

This same conclusion was well established in multiple threads after the Purdue game.",sports
"Sure. Before replay that most likely would have been the case. 

That said, it’s the same call it would have been if the Virginia player had hit the ball down and it bounced off the Tech guy’s knee and went out. It would have been more obvious but still the same call. Va ball.",sports
Lemme guess if they refs had called it out on UVA and then reversed it to TT on replay you would be praising the refs for a good call.  You are complaining how the game is meant to be played.,sports
"All I’m saying is there is a play like this in almost every game where the defender clearly it’s it hour but maybe it glances off the offensive player. Nobody says anything because the defender caused the ball to go out of bounds. I can see what your saying I just think it’s shitty. If you’re going to have replay, have it for the whole time and review every call so the “integrity of the game” is maximized, or don’t have it at all",sports
If you didn’t see the missed hack on Jerome then you really don’t know basketball. That was 20 times as obvious than the missed double dribble that at least more than half of viewers wouldn’t have spotted. You’re just complaining if you think there was no missed calls up until the double dribble. Auburn also doesn’t lose if they don’t miss a free throw or foul on a 3 pointer. Quit whining. This isn’t even in the ballpark of what Saints fans were complaining about.,sports
"Whatever helps you get through the day, guy.",sports
"i mean, i saw it real time....",sports
that foul is not obvious and is up to the refs discretion.  The double dribble is not up to any discretion what so ever.  That would be the difference here sir.,sports
that foul is not obvious and is up to the refs discretion. The double dribble is not up to any discretion what so ever. That would be the difference here sir. P childish to not even understand the simple rules mate,sports
"I don’t think it’s rigged, just annoying. I know what confirmation bias is. I was actually looking for a well officiated game, unlike UVA’s previous two, and was disappointed with how it ended.",sports
Alright what about the lane violation on the shooter?,sports
"Nah, just agreeing with a fellow redditor.",sports
Well the problem with that is it would cause games to last way to long if they were going to the booth for every single close call in a game. They need to find some happy medium which is why they do reviews late in games only. You can't possibly think TT was the better team last night,sports
"So, all these other people who never saw it don't know basketball either? Dude, how insecure do you have to be to insult someone comment after comment when all they wanted was a discussion on a sports game?

Once you show me a noncall that clearly alters the outcome, then I will agree that Virginia and Auburn both got screwed, and Virginia deserved the win.",sports
Thanks dude! I love seeing irrationally angry and salty people rant on the internet. Makes my day.,sports
"I ""saw"" it too but did not realize it was a double dribble.  Give it up dude, UVA earned the win by scoring more points.  All this bullshit about the refs is just bullshit.",sports
"The jersey grab is blatantly obvious and its not up to ""discretion""- its a foul that happened before the double dribble would have been called. So if you're going to complain about the double dribble that literally 99.9% of everyone watching did not notice in real time, then you have to complain about the blatantly obvious jersey grab.

"Let me see if I understand you.

Refs miss a foul: No problem
Refs miss a double dribble: Problem

Sooo.... your stance is that the refs are a problem not because they didn't make all the correct calls, but because they didn't make the correct call that you wanted.  Not sure that stands up to logical and intellectual scrutiny, but ok.",sports
They were for the most part decently officiated.,sports
"I don't recall seeing one but I may have missed it.  But you really can't just list every small error after the ""big"" ones you were touting were false.

But for one second be honest with yourself.  Do you really think the missed calls were entirely favoring UVA all tourny?  You already have at least one obvious missed call (foul against Jerome vs ~~Purdue~~ Auburn), my guess is some rose colored glasses might prevent you from seeing others.  

I understand the team you wanted to win at some point probably lost.  Its easier to find excuses in a rigged system than it is to admit team A outperformed team B.  Its a game, refs are human so mistakes happen.  Sometimes those mistakes can win/loose a game but  in my (admittedly biased) opinion no mistake made clearly gave UVA a win.",sports
"1.	I’m not the guy who even commented to you previously so your “comment after comment” note is erroneous. 
2.	The missed hack on Jerome was widely reported. It’s not like I have to prove anything to you. 
3.	Auburn fouled Jerome before the double dribble. Also widely reported. 
4.	You can’t even dispute the point that Auburn still wins if they just make a free throw or don’t foul a 3 point shooter. Act like refs gave them a game that Auburn had multiple opportunities to win.
I’m not even a UVA fan. You’re just delusional.",sports
"If your gripe in the Auburn game was the double dribble that literally no one in America saw live but every armchair ref brings up after they saw it in slow mo post game. Get over it everyone missed that. 

Now if it’s the 3 point foul, that is a 50/50 call and then we gotta replay Purdue-Tennessee because the exact same thing happened and for all we know Tennessee could have beat Tech by 20 tonight.",sports
"Yeah, calling an asshole an asshole really makes me rage. You got me.",sports
Its not my fault that double dribble is in the rules and you did not see it.,sports
"still frames mean nothin mate.

also idk if you just dont know the rules of bball or something but im not sure how you dont notice a quite obvious and blatant and absolutely in your face double dribble.  But hey apprently its u and liiiitttttterally 99% of others.",sports
You do not understand.  Try harder mate.,sports
"1. Yes, my bad.

2. I just searched Google, I can't find anything on it. What minute mark was it?

3. This was *definitely* not widely reported. After seeing the play, it also doesn't look like any foul, either.

4. Auburn up by 2 with only a few seconds left, and possession? It doesn't matter who had the chance to win; the point is that they were cheated. Your logic is just saying, ""It's okay that a team gets screwed over, because they weren't good enough to have a bigger lead."" Okay, then why isn't Virginia getting punished? They didn't have a big lead either, right?",sports
"The 3 point foul was an obvious foul on Auburn...

It doesn't matter who saw it live. Virginia still did undeservingly kept possession, right? And that ref was *right there*, he should have seen it.",sports
"Nope not your fault that the refs didn't see it either.

Hope you didn't lose too much money on the games!",sports
"Still frames mean everything. Its 100%, indisputable proof that a foul occurred before a double dribble would have been called and thus your bullshit ""they didn't deserve to be there"" doesn't hold up. So, next bullshit excuse?",sports
"I think I do understand.  The team you wanted to lose won, and you are having trouble accepting it.  As part of your ""bargaining"" phase of grief, you are trying to blame the refs.

Eventually you will arrive at the ""acceptance"" phase and be much happier.

Good luck to you!",sports
"4:36 left, Jerome gets hacked up 9. Should go to the line to potentially put them up 11. Instead no call, Auburn rebounds, Jerome fouls out of frustration. Next play Auburn hits a 3. That’s a 5 point swing from possibly being down 11 to being down 6. Shortly after that Auburn is neck and neck. And Auburn had been getting outplayed all second half to this point. That swing is massive, especially in a low scoring contest like that game. 
Then Jerome was fouled before the double dribble. Auburn was literally trying to foul because they had a foul to give. Auburn not only fouled him but did it on purpose. It worked against them unfortunately because the foul wasn’t significant enough and the ref was looking for when an intentional foul was clear enough to call, which is how he missed the double dribble because he didn’t realize it didn’t contact Auburn. 
The point is there’s numerous missed calls. And that double dribble was far from an obvious missed call. Even Barkley, an Auburn alum, wasn’t even salty about them missing that call. And on top of that it wasn’t that missed call that killed them. The foul killed them. The game was won. Like literally won. Guy wasn’t going to hit that jumper. They fouled and lost. Controversial? Yeah I guess but I’ve seen countless games in sports way more controversial than that. If it happened in the sweet sixteen the double dribble isn’t even egregious enough to merit much of a story. It’s just a painful loss.",sports
"Yes you are correct it is not my fault they missed a blatant and up to zero discretion call.

And I didn't lose any but I can see that is your go to diss lmao think of a new one mate",sports
"ima just stick with still frames don't mean shit.  By your proof we no that for at least one frame his hand touched the opponents jersey.  Not a foul. Even if it was on his body, not a foul. Just put the video and i will believe you maybe but ur still image does nothing for me",sports
No worries mate.  Hopefully next year you guys can win again but without this mess,sports
"So, in reality, they just lost 2 free throws. Auburn hitting a 3 is beside the point, because they could have very well done the same after Virginia's free throws. That would still leave Auburn with the ball and tied, rather than up 2, assuming that both Virginia makes those 2 free throws *and* everything else goes the same, with a few seconds left. That still seems like Auburn would've won.",sports
"Then you are upset for no reason.  How sad....

NEXT!!!",sports
"What a world we live in. I offer indisputable proof of a foul and you just go with ""don't mean shit"". His hand didn't just ""touch"" the opponents jersey, its a grab which makes it a foul. Touching an opponents jersey isn't a foul. Grabbing is and his jersey is obviously being pulled towards the defender.

I am not going to go look for the video out there with the correct angle, I am sure you can find it since this is the hot topic now.",sports
"There is no ""mess"" but what's in your mind.  Media sites know that controversy gets mouse-clicks so they are drumming up BS about the refs.  You took this drumming up at face value.

NEXT!",sports
Auburn should have won anyway regardless of this argument. Then they fouled a 3 point shooter with next to no time left up 2. That’s what lost them the game.,sports

Like I have held so much hate for a man I don't personally know. There have been many of players I didn't like, but when it came time for them to retire I found myself appreciating what they had done in their sports. Not Wade. I was glad to see him going. Wishing him nothing but the worst. Foolish I know, but the anger from 06 finals was too strong. You'd think in 11 I would have found redemption and moved on. I didn't. I could ramble on for an hour over all the feelings I have had for this man. Knowing how stupid it was to feel this way about someone over a sports game. Yet I clicked this video. Almost didn't because I was afraid it may chip away at this wall of hate I have for him. After watching that video not only did it chip away at that wall. It tore it completely down. How can I sit here and hold hate in for a man who clearly has done good with his opportunities in life. I sit here bitter about his success instead of improving myself and those around me. I can't pay for a person's college tuition, but I could be doing something to help someone. I am sorry Mr. Wade for the hate I have gave you. It didn't affect you at all I know, only affected myself. Takes so much energy to hate someone. I'm sorry I have wasted that energy on such a purposeless cause. Congrats on your outstanding career and thank you for helping not only those people, but the thousands of others I am sure you have helped. I hope your retirement brings you happiness.",sports

"Watched it without sound & it was just moving, but unlike California, my eyes are not in a drought.",sports
"This made me tear up, you’re a good man Dwyane Wade.",sports
Absolute legend. An inspiration to all. I need more tissue,sports
"This is why I love sports and like the fact my son is getting into sports now too. It gives people something to look forward to, something to believe in, something to work hard towards, and sometimes it gives much more than that. Not all athletes are role models or even want to be role models, but then you see a guy like Wade. He takes out time in his busy life to let others know that he cares and changes their lives forever.  Absolutely beautiful right here.",sports
"This is a great reminder that we're all human despite our origins, our story, and our path. Heavy stuff on a Tuesday morning, but great nonetheless!",sports
Good for him. Somewhere along in his life he was told he should give back. Now he deserves to feel good about something he brought to this world. Nice.,sports
What a punch in the guy. Amazing job Budweiser.,sports
"Oh good god, why would yo show me that",sports
R/sports? More like r/cry,sports
My eyes are sweating,sports
"As a fan and as some one who lives in South Florida Thank you Wade
Wadecounty baby!!!",sports
"Fuccck

Those feels were not asked for but needed today",sports
"Using all this to promote shitty beer seems weird. Great commercial, weird premise for creating it.",sports
I gotta say so many commercials are bullshit or purposely trying to tap into your emotions to push a brand or product for money. Budweiser you have out down yourself.. this was truly beautiful I would have loved a longer documentary style of Wade and his great accomplishments on and off the court.,sports
Now go have a bud👍,sports
"This man is doing while we're all sitting around hoping.

God, I really am a shit example of a human being.",sports
Man lebrons now gon retire just to 1 up this,sports
Cool ad,sports
Did they intend for me to cry like this? Omg,sports
I just teared up in a Qdoba,sports
Fuck Budweiser,sports
I dont know anything about basketball or how important Dwayne is for the sport. But from all the stories those people told I think he deserves the world because he's such a nice person. I might be crying a little,sports
Wife is wondering why I’m tearing up over here... Here’s to you 3!,sports
"I don’t know who this guy is, but damn he’s an inspiration.",sports
Wayyy more than an athlete! Kudos!!,sports
Just got busted by my wife crying to this. Now she is crying watching it. Then I’m going to go let it make my 14 year old son cry. Is it dusty in here?,sports
"To me, this is almost exactly 100% the opposite of Scott's Tots.",sports
Dang onions in my nachos got in my eyes.,sports
I'm not crying you're crying,sports
I’M NOT CRYING. YOU’RE CRYING,sports
"I'm not crying, you're crying. Shut up....

&#x200B;

Also, I don't follow basketball at all. Really, at all. But here I am, tears down my eyes...",sports
Whos chopping onions ...,sports
"Always, onions! Why the onions?!",sports
"Maybe I'm being too cynical - but these are all great things dwayne wade did, and its very touching... and then at the end it's an advertisement for budweiser.  
  
funny enough though, I'm about to go buy a 6 pack of budweiser from the store, but still.",sports
Could use a Budweiser and a Dwayne Wade Jersey now,sports
"Unpopular Opinion, but all his jersey swaps and the camera crew following him makes everything feel very forced. Though I speak from a biased view as Mavs fan.

Edit: I'm referring to player jersey swaps after most of his games.",sports
/r/HailCorporate,sports
Wow D Wade is way cooler than I ever knew,sports
"Budweiser *Commercial

You dumb fucking consumers gimme more money",sports
"I’m not crying, you’re crying",sports
Holy shit it’s 830 in the morning and I’m in fucking tears. The title to this subreddit lives up to its name. Dwade is the man👍🏽,sports
"Man, that was a tear jerker.  Always makes me happy when people can use their position to help or change other people's lives for the better.",sports
[deleted],sports
Dwyane....we love you.,sports
I AM crying AND you're crying.,sports
Kudos to Dwayne Wade and the Budweiser marketing team.,sports
"Holy fuck.
I don’t watch pro sports, I have no idea who this man is, but I know he did good by those people. 
Good on him, I teared up in my cube. 
Stupid music and good editing.",sports
"When his mom came out, that’s what sealed it all for me. That’s when the water works turned on.",sports
Deep,sports
It’s a terrible day for rain,sports
"We will miss you Dwayne. Years ago I had an employee on my team who was one of his teachers in school growing up. From the time he was in college she told me that he was a ""good one"", just a good boy/man. He has proven her correct.",sports
God damn the feels. jeez,sports
I can’t handle much more of this... my favorite player ever is playing his last regular season home game tonight... 😢,sports
I’m definitely not crying in my Budweiser.,sports
Yo who is cutting onions,sports
I didn't know anything about D. Wade before this (don't follow bball) but now I understand why people like him,sports
Dwade for prez!!,sports
Co workers are wondering why I am crying now.,sports
"Man... as a kid who was raised almost entirely by a single mom, the part with his mother.. it just hit a different way...",sports
My tear ducts are wonky.,sports
Dwayne’s mom gave him a lakers blazer lmao,sports
Cleveland Cavaliers Legend !,sports
It's gonna suck without him. He'll never be forgotten,sports
"F you Budweiser, I’m trying to eat lunch",sports
"This beats out the Dale Jr one, give the guys making these a raise.",sports
Fuck I really need more water but I gotta stay in my cube til it doesn’t look like I’ve been crying anymore lmao idk why I kept watching at work I knew exactly what I was doing but I couldn’t look away,sports
"“Hold on”
* rubs both eyes*
“Something flew into both my eyes”",sports
Top notch kinda guy right there.,sports
All these years and I never realized it was spelled Dwyane...,sports

Budwiser got me right in the feels.,sports
Wrecked,sports
Oh.....I thought all of that was implied by the title of the post....,sports

That is beautiful,sports
Wow I got chills,sports
This isn't the first time Budweiser has made me cry.,sports
respect,sports
"I don't actually like basketball , but i found myself here crying.",sports
Ughhh crying.,sports
*Mudiay somewhere punching the air rn*,sports
 Not really a Wade fan and not a big basket ball fan but I'm teary eyes in the back office bathroom right now.,sports
The Dale Jr one is better,sports

"I have no idea who this heart is,  but he made me cry.",sports
I was reading the comments before watching the video and I was like why’s everyone crying for. Then I watched the video and it hit me like a train 😭😭😭😭😭😭,sports
I wouldn't be able to do this without crying,sports
And I'm crying,sports
"I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING ... Dear God this was an incredible tribute, pretty wholesome from Budweiser.",sports
Who the hell started cutting onions in my office!,sports
"I'm not crying, you're crying. Shut up! 😭😭😭😭",sports
Damn dude... this hit me HARD,sports
Great player. Even better human.,sports
Damn allergies flared up right in the middle of the video,sports

There's no crying in basketball. But GD if I didn't just cry like a baby,sports
Good riddance. Bye bye drama queen.,sports
By all account he seems like a really nice guy but I don’t for a second believe this was all a surprise.,sports
I'm crying on my lunch break you assholes,sports
I watched it muted and I was waiting for actual players to show up and trade jerseys. I wasn’t disappointed when I turned on the sound. I might be crying,sports
"Good commercial. Damn the tear in my eye. I remember when I was in the second grade in FL I grew up surrounded by Basketball and The Heat and the chant they had when they won thier first championship in 06. To see Wade grow up and be a fan of his and the team and to hear he left the heat and came back it was all hard but damn the man is finally done, dude is finally putting down the jersey and shooting his last professional hoops.",sports
Very emotional.,sports
Heave cry.,sports
No you’re crying.,sports
Jesus christ.  What a good human being. Why arent more billionaire athletes like this?!?!,sports

"Ugh, right in the feels...",sports

I always enjoyed watching Dwyane Wade the basketball player but I had no idea the depth of his empathy and philanthropy.  

He's a good man.

Ugly crying at work.,sports
Oh hey crying is fun,sports
This guy must be making a killing with all his drug stores around NYC.,sports
"It's impossible to hate Dwyane Wade. To think the Pistons could of drafted him instead of Darco haunts me to this day. Even when he teamed up with LeBron I hated that team and what how imo it was against the spirit of the game and more about ego.... except Wade. Couldn't be mad at him, it was his team, he was there from the start.",sports
"Damn, I didn't expect to cry today, but I ain't mad, I'm just crying.",sports

Nothing recharges you more than an emotional poo.,sports

"I'm not able to watch at the moment, but I'm inferring from the comments that it's other people Wade has helped.",sports
I didn’t see Frank Mason’s jersey up on that wall though...,sports

i teared up a butt,sports
Who the fucks cutting onions?,sports
Dammit Budweiser..just bring back the horses..I'm crying over here!,sports
The outreach that Dwayne and other athletes do is incredible. These guys are very much role models for so many kids. They are slowly changing lives one person at a time.,sports
When did Budweiser’s brand switch from those stupid frogs to “we’re gonna make you ugly cry and you’re gonna like it”? Those damn horse and dog Super Bowl ads had me bawling too.,sports
I don't wanna admit to crying but when he got the championship kids Jersey.......ooof.,sports
Man that hit deep,sports
Obligatory fuck dwade,sports
"Bruh I didnt need the cry while eating lunch. But thank you , I feel better now.",sports
"I’m not crying, you’re crying!",sports
Wow didn't think I'd end my day by crying at a Budweiser ad,sports
What a great video. How can you not be a fan of Dwayne Wade! That was incredible. What a role model.,sports
"I don't follow basketball, and I have no idea who this guy is. But at a time in my life when I need to be reminded how to be a good man, this made me tear up.

Good on him, whoever he is.",sports
Damn onion cutting ninjas,sports
Chi Town legend,sports
"Ahhh man, I was not ready for this",sports
Budweiser is good at making emotional ads. The one with Dale Earnhardt Jr. was a really good send off for his career.,sports
I'm crying like a bitch..just saying,sports
"Never thought I'd cry on the toilet again, but here we are.",sports
Oh man. 😭,sports
We need more commercials with messages like this... absolutely amazing,sports
I ugly cried,sports
Man who’s chopping onions in here? Good grief.,sports
Don't watch this at work just don't,sports
"Basketball players come and go

Legends live forever",sports
Yep crying now,sports
Man they are really making Paul Pierce sad.,sports
Why is the screen so blurry. Tears,sports
Thought this was going to be a terrible Chevy commercial,sports
Please Wade one more year. I can’t take it anymore. I’m going to miss you,sports
"Goddamn, he is a much better man than I.",sports
"Dude was an obvious superstar in college, and stayed normal throughout his whole career.

This was really deep. I had no idea the hardships he had been through. Mad respect.",sports
Man I need a Budweiser.,sports
Stupid brain rain,sports
What a role model I’m crying 😭😭,sports
Can somebody please re upload the video? This one is all blurry.,sports
I got sand in my eyes.,sports
I seem to have a foreign object in my eye... Everything is looking a little blurry,sports
Joaquin's sister is gorgeous,sports
Some commercials these days are way more wholesome and touching than anything you'll see on primetime.,sports
Who is cutting onions in this office? Whoooooo?!? (cries),sports
"Sweet video. Still don't want a Budweiser, though.",sports
Was not prepared to tear up. Good commercial.,sports
Since when did bud make beer out of onions?,sports
"Why am I crying rn, this is whack",sports
I'm surprised rondo didn't swap jerseys with him after wade tried ripping his arm out of it's socket.,sports
This hit me right in the feels.,sports
I might be crying. This was very well done but would haven’t been a possibility if it wasn’t for generosity. The NBA is losing not only a phenomenal athlete but a great person. I salute you Dwayne Wade,sports
Got me.,sports
fuck paul pierce,sports
I’m not crying you are,sports
"Incredible player, even better person. Gonna miss you D-Wade.",sports
Anyone else want the first guy to say hi dad,sports
I hate it when the cut onions at the smoothie place. Gosh darn it.,sports
I’m on the toilet holding back tears,sports
I cried like a baby.,sports
Which asshole tagged this under r/sports! I didn't come to r/sports to cry!,sports
Damn Budweiser now I’m tearing up and I don’t like that,sports
I wish he caught that body at the staples.,sports
"Fun fact: my divorce lawyer that I had the misfortune of getting to know all too well confided in me that he represented Dwayne Wade’s wife in their divorce. He had to “fire” her....as did apparently 4 other prominent Chicago divorce attorneys. 

You know when you are basically a multimillion dollar client and your divorce attorney fires you, you must be a gargantuan pain in the ass. 

He confided that he was done after the 6 page emotional emails that would end in “and the Good Lord will hear my vengeance” and similar stuff .",sports
This made my day,sports
Where was Wade when Mudiay needed help?,sports
Gahhh you da fucking man Wade! Love you long time,sports
"Wow, I never knew how much he quietly gives back.  Thanks for making the world a better place Dwayne.",sports
That man is an inspiration and a hero,sports
I was not ready for this,sports
"That is wonderfully made. I dont follow basketball, but he seems to be an exceptional person.",sports
"Holy fuck, I started choking and crying.",sports
Damn I need a beer,sports
"Jesus I’m sitting here with tears rolling down my face for the first time in years. I can’t remember the last time something made cry like this, but god damn. This shit is beautiful.",sports
Holy shit that was emotional af. Wade the man.,sports
"I’m not crying... you’re crying! 

All jokes aside, the world needs more people like D. Wade. A true hero and someone our little ones can look up too. 

Congrats on a phenomenal career Dwyane. But more importantly thanks for being a great human being.",sports
I’m crying at work :(,sports
Wow.,sports
"I hardly ever watch basketball, and I barely even know who Dwyane Wade is, but I have an immense amount if respect for him after this video. What a genuinely incredible guy.",sports
Omg I didn’t think a Budweiser commercial could ever ever ever fuck me up like this,sports
"No, no, that's just pollen making my eyes red and crying...",sports
What's this blurry font you're all using?,sports
Drink Beer,sports
"Damn, that hit me, I love Dwayne wade.",sports

Who the fuck brought in these onions?,sports
"I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!",sports
"If you don’t upvote this, fuck you. I’M NOT CRYING, YOU ARE.",sports
Right in the feels... hot damn I was not expecting this whilst eating dinner...,sports
One of the best things I've seen on Reddit!,sports
Damn it I'm about 15 minutes from clocking in for work trying so dang hard not to ugly cry. This was too beautiful.,sports
"If real men dont cry, then we are all fucked.",sports

"Wow. Just, wow.",sports
That shit just touched feels I didn’t even know I had...,sports
I'm not crying you're crying.,sports
I was really hoping the horses would come out with that dog,sports
That’s fuckin dope. Low key made me tear up,sports

This was so heartwarming,sports
"I just popped in from all.  I don't like basketball.  I don't know who that person is. I don't like bud light.

But I did cry.  Damn you all!",sports
"Yo I’m just here trying to shit now, I got tears rolling down my face. Thanks Reddit.",sports
"I... I UHH, need to go and by a 6 pack.",sports
Holy shit how could a commercial make me tear up and feel that way,sports

"As a Mavs fan I hated DWade in 2006, I don’t hate him anymore.",sports
You bastard.  My cat is now judging me crying.,sports
Damn! Who's cutting onions! That was too much.,sports

Man I dont even watch basketball and I'm crying,sports
This man is hero material.,sports
"I’m not crying, you’re crying",sports
Thats a man right there. A good man.,sports
This is what we are striving for as a country. Being bigger and better and uplifting. Thanks Wade.,sports
Nobody finds it disturbing that without this man's generosity a woman would have gone to college and a family would lose everything in a house fire?,sports
It’s not like I’m crying or anything but.... my 2 year old daughter is asking why I’m crying.   I better get her to bed,sports
I am a moron.  I read the post title as Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock and was very confused when regular people showed up to exchange jerseys with Wade.,sports
"I’m not crying, Reddit! You’re crying! Son of a bitch.",sports
"Well fuck Budweiser :,)

Anybody else’s comment section looking kinda blurry...",sports
I have to be up in a couple hours and now this got me sad.....nothing but love Wade.,sports
"Damnit, got me over here tearing up. Good that we have good people like D Wade.  What a great guy.",sports
"D. Wade has always been my favorite player. 

Where are those damn onions being cut??",sports
The only beer I drink is an emotional Budweiser and I hate a bitchy Coors Light.,sports
I don’t think this is a very good commercial.,sports
"I'm not crying, you're crying!",sports
That made me cry but Budweiser is still gross,sports
Dwyane's mom sound just like AOC.,sports
"I'm not crying, you're crying.  

And I hate basketball!  ...but Dwayne Wade is my favorite.",sports
Well at least I’m not the only one holding back tears. This was beautiful.,sports
I didn’t know I loved Dwayne Wade until now,sports
"Fuck, now I’m crying in break room at work looking crazy af. Thanks d-Wade. You a real one.",sports
That was unfair.,sports
Well god damn! Unexpected.. gut punch..,sports
Fuck yeah! DALE!,sports
😥,sports
Shut up. I’m not crying. You are!,sports
NO LOVE FOR KEVIN HUERTER,sports
"Goddamn, that got me bad",sports
Geez I need a beer!,sports
And crying. Dammit!,sports
Who is the gentleman who gives him the jacket and where have I seen him? This is driving me nuts.,sports
"Tears...I can’t even describe it.  What an amazing person that I didn’t know about.  I knew him as an extraordinary ball player but not as the kind of man he is.  Here’s to you Mr. Wade.  You make me proud to say I’m from Chicago.   

Cheers to your future.",sports
Fuck. Broke me down.,sports
Remember that time he tackled rondo in the playoffs and nearly broke his arm. Dirty Wade,sports
"If I tell you to suck my dick are you going to change your mind on this? Probably not. No one cares because it is the internet and then they just ignore. Keep engaging and asking questions. Just like in life, having an engaging conversation where both parties participate is going to be much more fruitful. Someone says the stuff you said to me and I’m just gonna ignore them. In fact it makes me dislike your position even more and I agree with you.",sports
He always showed my hometown mad love. Miami is gonna miss him. Edit for typos.,sports
"Simply amazing! Good luck, Mr. Wade, on your future endeavors and continuing with being a great human being.",sports
"Goddamnit, its not even 8am AND I gotta cry",sports
I’ve never watched basketball ever... if it produces people like this I better start watching ASAP,sports
"D-Wade has been one of my favorite players since he came into the league back in 03. He is a great fucking guy and an amazing player, and we will miss him dearly. You're than man, Dwyane.",sports
"I don't cry over sports things (like what the olympics tries to make you do). I honestly didn't like D-Wade when he played earlier in his career. I especially didn't like him when people said he was better than Kobe.
BUT THIS.
This is what makes me care. This is what makes me cry, makes me happy. He is such a great human being. Knowing that he touched all of those people's lives not just for what he did on the court, but for the many many contributions he made off the court, in not just his community, but all communities.
D-Wade, please don't change. Please don't stop caring about others. You are what makes this world a better place.",sports
Wow that tugs on the heart strings.,sports
"You almost tricked me into watching a four minute long commercial.

Almost.",sports
Good stories and tremendous people but seriously??? To use them for a commercial to sell shitty beer? Seriously!?!?,sports
Who was the guy who gave him the blazer? Was he just influenced by Wade?,sports
As soon as the girl mentioned his brother was one of the Parkland victims I broke. I broke hard.,sports
"I'm not a basketball person, and I don't know who he is, but from what I saw, he is a 10/10 legend.",sports
Awwwwww. That was like sweet and stuff.,sports
Respect.,sports
"I'm not crying, you're crying",sports
"i am not crying,,i am not... oooh no...",sports
I wonder if deaf people wonder why these videos are labeled emotional.,sports
Wade has been an incredible role model.,sports
Wow! That's a true spirit of helping others ❤️,sports
"Now I have to show with tears in my eyes to the office, thanks Dwyane Wade and Budweiser",sports
Where’s Paul Pierce’s coor’s light tribute commercial? Guess this settles who had the better NBA career lol,sports
Great video about a man who used his position and wealth for good. Just a shame it's also advertising something.,sports
Shame it was an ad for shit awful beer. But it’s a spectacular and heartwarming ad,sports
"I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!",sports
Damn allergies kicking in,sports
"I don’t know anything about this guy or what swapping jerseys means, but shit I’m crying now.",sports
I think budweiser would have looked better if they did this without taking credit,sports
f... me this is awesome!,sports
"This commercial played at the end of a YouTube video, i skipped it, and it played at the beginning of the next YouTube video. So now i hate it and Budweiser.",sports
"Man DWade is starting to be looked on as the #1 athlete of all time in Miami. Maybe it's recency bias maybe not, but right now he's over taking Dan Marino in this town. I'm hoping getting out of basketball will give him even more time to give back like this.",sports
Y Budweiser doe?,sports
"I'm not crying, you're crying!",sports
"Stop. Fucking. Being. Manipulated. God damn people you fucking worship corporations and their commercials. It's pathetic and disgusting how much you allow them to manipulate you. You fucking enjoy being advertised to. This isn't some moving indie film, it's a fucking billion dollar company tricking you into emotional vulnerability so they can get your money from you.

"Really interesting to compare the send offs of Dirk and Wade, both correlating to their playstyle and personalities. One humble and organic; keeping his nose to the grindstone and almost avoiding the attention, the other is begging for attention to reassure himself of his validity and has to latch on to other names to secure it be it the pro names on the  traded jerseys or his PR/Agent firm to produce this ad.

There was the Budweiser 9/11 tribute ad that ran during the 2012 Super Bowl. The only time this ad ran was during the game because they didn't want to commercialize the tragedy, but desired to pay respect the way only Budweiser can. If you were around then, you'll surely remember the national sentiment at the time. I was a mess after watching the original. The ad never aired again.

I am mad, he CLEARLY wasn't touched on replay yet they whistled a foul?   Why is he getting to shoot two AGAIN?!  Is anyone going to stop this officiating crew?

Tell you what, Stern - you investigate these officals, we'll replay game 6 again cleanly.  It doesn't have to end this way.  

This is it.  I'm burning all my teams stuff and never watching again.  I can't take this, we'll never come this close again.  

But finally I accepted I was witnessing one of the greats put on a clinic of what 'a whole new level of playoff intensity' *looked* like.  I realized I was hating a man for what he did to my team, not because he was a bad person or anything.  I didn't want to admit just how skilled he was.  

I still remember Bill Simmons joke - the 2007 Mavs draft pick walks up to shake David Stern's hand but is instead whistled for a foul on Dwyane Wade.

"I'm not a huge basketball guy so I didn't know any of the story about his mom. For those like me, Dwayne's parents divorced when he was 4 months old and he stayed with his mom. She was addicted to all kinds of stuff; heroin, meth, alcohol and so on. He lived in a rough part of Chicago, surrounded by drug dealing and gang activity, so he saw all the things a child shouldn't be seeing. His mom ended up getting in trouble and the cops came looking for her with guns drawn raiding the house. She wasn't arrested then, but Dwayne's sister brought him to his fathers house where he lived for a few years. In that time his mother had gone to jail for possession and intent to distribute charges and spent about 2 years at Cook County. He only saw her once during that time, and not much else until college. When he was at Marquette, he went home to visit her and was told she was going back to jail for 14 months after spending the past few years in and out of prison. In 2003 she got clean and vowed to change her life for the better. And I couldn't actually find much on the Church Dwayne bought her but I assume that really helped her out too because she was in Church when she decided it was time to turn her life around. Very touching story and I wish I had that background before watching this video.",sports

It didn't take me long to see that Wade was a player and man to be respected and admired, both for his incredible play on the court and his work in the community outside basketball.

"The point is no matter what Budweiser does as a company, unless they do it completely anonymously, it’s 100% done with the intention of increasing profits. It’s probably illegal for them to spend money without a profit motive sine it’s publicly traded. This is true for any company that does something charitable or nice. They will make far more money than they spent on this ad if their marketing team did their job right. 
Even if you like this ad, which is fine, you should keep in mind that it doesn’t mean Budweiser, or any other company, is morally “good” and their intent is to make you like them and associate their name with good things.",sports
"Totally. I'd HAPPILY put together something like this myself... except I don't know any deserving people like this - certainly not famous ones. I don't know how to contact them, either. Oh, and I have approximately 0% of the necessary money to shoot and edit this.

So good for Budweiser.",sports
Everyone is aware that it is a commercial for Budweiser. It's not trying to subvert you. It can be an ad and still be engaging and emotional. Reddit has a real hate-boner for advertising.,sports
[deleted],sports
And they can do that without jerking off the company on reddit and giving free advertising and shit,sports
Counterpoint. People who actually give a fuck about basketball can make videos and we can stop normalizing the takeover of all parts of our world by advertising and manipulation. The more you suck their dicks for advertising and attempting to control you but being kind enough to lube up to fuck you and make it a good video the more ads will continue to take over society.,sports
"Imagine being such a bitch you defend a major Corp that is purely motivated by greed to manipulate the fuck out of you. They didn't make this video because they like the player. They wanted to capitalize on a chance to boost sales so they put put this fake as fuck emotional manipulator designed by people who study psychology and human behetheir entire lives to learn the best ways to subconsciously control the highest percent of the population possible. They don't care about basketball they care about making money. And everyone watching this and upvoting it and giving it gold and shit are falling right into the trap and whether those people buy the product or not they are facilitating and disgusting infiltration of every aspect of society by advertising and manipulation to support the wealthiest people in the world.

If you wanna watch tribute videos of a great player, find some made by actual fans who actually care about the situation.",sports
There's a difference between being aggressive and throwing cheap shots.,sports
"That image is from the 2011 finals. Dirk was sick... Wade and LeBron both decided to mock him but covering their mouth and nose like school children douchebags.

Dirk got his by embarrassing both of them on the court (more so LeBron with the worst finals performance in NBA history) and winning a ring on their watch.",sports
*Hi human!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** lil__jimmy! ^(hug),sports
"Absolutley not, I said kudos for inspiring people. I just think Wade is overrated and an attention seeker. At each one of the jersey trades after games, there were media credentials for a Wade documentary that is being produced by his PR firm and this is part of that. 
Again, awesome that he inspires people and they were able to share that with him.",sports
Stop it! Stop it right now! Budweiser paid A LOT of money for this video and Reddit post and we're not gonna have you pissing off in their advertisement.,sports
I actually find it the most chuggable and for that I thank them,sports
Video made my cry. There is literally no way in hell though I will ever drink a Budweiser.,sports
"It doesn't contain corn syrup, only the freshest rice!",sports
"I see it as praise, but I'm just countering by saying this is a commercial to sell beer and Wade was compensated to be in this to sell more beer.  I don't like these ads that tie consumer products and selling to serious societal issues.  I mean he's supposedly having this heart to heart with his mom while a big budweiser banner is in the background.  Its a little sick if you ask me.",sports
"Honestly, I agree with you. I hate advertisers tapping into these instincts and emotions to sell products and services. 

But at the same time, I've never been a Wade fan. I always thought he was a bit of an ass. Clearly I had it wrong.

And if that change of opinion comes at the price of seeing the Budweiser logo and slogan a few times, it's worth it to me.",sports
"Really I don't remember even seeing a Budweiser loo that whole video, I'm sure they were there but definitely didn't take away from the message or get to intrusive.",sports
Except on the court in LA,sports
Because that's what their audience wants to hear.  Nothing more to it,sports

Honestly can’t tell if this is /whoosh or /s,sports
"But their brand is associated with this good deed - at the end of day this gesture isn't realistically gonna affect their bottom line - no matter what Budweiser is gonna do just fine. But they took the time and planning and paid a bunch of people money to organize this and make this happen. I have lots of problems with ads and capitalism in general but in my opinion stuff like this is okay. A powerful entity in society did something good and heartwarming, so I'm gonna take that at face value and be happy about it.",sports
"Great point... I can't control my subconscious brain anymore than the advertiser, I just think of myself as a rational consumer",sports
"So not the ads fault, just the thing that shows them. I agree for the most part, I see no solution though",sports
People got paid to exploit their dead relatives so that Budweiser sells more beer. The point of this video is that it will help Budweiser sell more beer.,sports
Do you know how companies work? They wouldn’t have spent the money on it if the focus group testing showed it wouldn’t help sell Budweiser. Whats annoying is you thinking that just because this ad doesn’t make you want to buy Budweiser than it must mean the ad was not meant to try and sell Budweiser.,sports
It's not bad if you know which ones they own and look on the packaging for the Independent Brewery Seal. It's an upside down bottle logo.,sports
"Well, one, you’re right, I was misunderstanding the point of that sub. Two, I don’t have to be rocking a raging hate-boner to roll my eyes at corporate campaigns like this. Three, if you view this ad without any of the context of this post or it coming from a Budweiser account or something, there’s nothing about Budweiser in this ad except for courtside ads which are clearly framed in a way to suggest that it’s just happenstance. I’m not like, mad about this commercial, but yeah, definitely pretty cynical about the presentation and motivations surrounding it.

I don’t want to let any of that—and I understand a lot of people will reflexively feel that that’s what I’m trying to do— take away from the fact that DWade really is the man and this commercial portrays him very much as he is. I’m not trying to take away anyone’s enjoyment of this piece, I enjoyed it quite a lot. I just feel that the association between DWades wholesomeness and shitty rice beer is superficial at best. 

But yeah, I know nobody asked me for my critique or wanted to hear it, so I’m sorry. DWade rules. Downvote away.",sports
"Yeah, Vayner did Budweiser’s",sports
You think it cost $0 to make that ad?,sports
"It's not so much that I disagree with you, you're just an asshole.",sports

"Points to Anheuser-Busch, though, because at least rice is a naturally occurring product.",sports

I think theres a bit more to it personally. They seem much more willing than cnn/msnbc to directly attack the intelligence of whoever is commenting like Laura did with LeBron right there and I think that's because their audience is insecure about their own intelligence.,sports

I got respect for LeBron now after he got the Cavs a ring though",sports
The lol was supposed to imply that it is /s,sports
"A different take: they really wanted to say thank you to Wade but never got a chance to do so. Budweiser calls up with an opportunity to say thanks in an even more meaningful way and in person.

I'm sure it's something they would have done for free regardless, so if they got paid it's not an issue because it didn't change anything. No behavior was inauthentic.

That being said, I'm still not drinking any Bud. I like beer that tastes like beer  :)",sports
I dont think you understand how advertising works either,sports
"Budweiser coordinated, planned, and filmed (or fronted the bill) for this, they made this ad to reflect on the personal life and outside of the game career of a genuinely good person that some people (myself included) did not know, this is the idea of credits, if you help make something then you should be credited for it. 

If ESPN, Fox Sports, NBC Universal, Air Jordan, or whatever tv channel or brand coordinated this effort you'd see a logo at the bottom too. You can say Dwades relationship to Budweiser is superficial I don't believe that I have ever seen much if any collaboration between the two, but taking credit for an ad that shows what a good person a person is would not be cynical.",sports
"Who the fuck cares if they spent money to manipulate you of course they did youre just strawmaning, they're gonna profit from it or they wouldn't have spent the money, so stop contributing to ads taking over society.",sports
"Nothings gonna change if everyone keeps sucking the companies dicks. If you truly agreed with me you wouldn't think I'm an asshole. If someone calls out shitty behavior like someone who's a theif or whatever and no one is paying attention and I was like holy fuck guys stop letting him steal from you you wouldn't think I'm an asshole, but since I'm calling out something you enjoy I am.",sports
"Congratulations, you're old. It was shitty then and it's shitty now.",sports

Nah I just haven’t found a substitute for the hoppy-ness of Budweiser. I was the dude chugging PBR at parties because I liked the skunk flavor,sports
Budweiser is so incredibly drinkable. Yeah it doesn't have a whole lot of flavor but that's the purpose. Less filling and low alcohol content. You can have a handful at a Sunday BBQ and still make it home safe and not wake up for work feeling like shit.,sports
"The message isn't bad either. Whatever it is you do drink, ""this bud's for 3""... doesn't have to be interpreted as advertising. It *is* advertising sure, but they're also taking a moment to remind everyone who just thinks of this man as a basketball player, love him or hate him, that he has done great things to positively affect the lives of others and maybe dedicating a single drink to him and/or those like him is something we can all do",sports
"I agree, but I would point out that cnn/MSNBC have different viewership. And over time FOX has... aligned itself more and more strongly with a certain insecure section of the population. They don't want to feel safe, or educated, they just want to look down their noses at the world and feel like they don't have to do anything to be better than someone else. 

The truth is no one is better or worse than anyone else, in the end we are all on one earth together and we need to act like it, and take care of it together... but I'm getting off topic",sports

"I’m just cynical about corporate motivation for ads like this because it’s so clearly disingenuous on behalf of the corporation. AB-InBev only shares these values in so far as it is a convenient source of profit.

With that said, i think we have a tendency in modern discourse to associate any critiques of media or rhetoric as a desire to destroy or silence that media. This commercial is nice, i really enjoyed it. I have no desire to see it destroyed or anything. I have no doubt that the writers, producers, directors, DWade and all the people involved in the production process were genuinely engaged and passionate about this piece. That’s why it turned out so well and is so moving! I love DWade, if AB-InBev wants to pay him to tell these inspirational stories, hell yeah he should do it.

Anyways, M-I-Z baby!",sports
"I think his point of view is pretty obvious and simple, and he mentioned a few times he’s not trying to minimize d wade.  He simply doesn’t like using all of d wades accomplishments to sell beer.

I was expecting it to taste like shit so at least my friend's attempt to fuck with me could backfire somewhat, but it just tasted like tepid sparkling water.",sports

Actually botting upvotes are quite cheap,sports
"Oh I mean I honestly didn't even get that far, watched up until they all swapped items and had that scene of them all hugging and his mom telling him he's more than a basketball player, at that point I was getting chocked up and had to switch off. I mean I could care less about the advertisement honestly that wasn't really my message either, the damn Budweiser logo is on the only screen behind Wade and it's more prominent than that little message, but I still didn't really care. Like you said the message that was trying to be sent was more of what I was focused on as well and it was a good tribute to the player too.",sports
"Hey look, one of the insecure guys showed up.",sports
"What I'm doing may not be perfect, but I whole heartedly disagree with you saying what I'm doing is further empowering them. If I just quietly and meekly mentioned that I disagree with a large aspect of out shared culture nobody would pay attention. People are so entrenched in world that corporations have designed that they will not be shaken free by some understated mention of the pitfalls of capitalism. Venting my frustrations in a passionate yet abrasive way gets the ideas into peoples heads better and stronger, same way corps use annoying as fuck ads, it allows the idea to penetrate and soak into their consciousness even if they don't like the delivery method.

A light tap isn't gonna wake people from this level of sleep, most need a bucket of ice water poured on them. I do appreciate you sharing your opinions and do concede that there are more appropriate ways to create change in the world, but for an off the cuff comment, I went strongly worded and I'm okay with that.",sports
"Enjoy living life like a zombie letting corporations control you. If you think it's just this post that's sad. It's so much more than that, and yes I am passionate about the things that are fucked up in this world including the over reach of corporate advertising, and that among many other personal values have a large impact on my life, and no living a principaled life and being upset by things that go against my moral values is not a bad thing.

If you think they don't have the ability to affect peoples subconscious choices and thoughts and actions you're just naive. You may not buy more of their product because of the video, but it's about more than you and me, it's the big picture and the state of the culture that bothers me. If you still don't see why it's so fucked up I have nothing left to say to you, but I wish you look in opening your eyes. Who cares you ask? Everybody who is in control of their own mind and body and destiny and is sick of the constant attempts at large scale manipulation cares.

"just because you can climb the fence, doesn’t mean you should.",sports
Damn,sports
He must need contacts.,sports
"Lol. Had the ball even had the power to get out he STILL wasn’t in the right position to catch it. 

Dude just needs to stop trying to get on SC Top 10.",sports
Oof,sports
Goes for the highlight catch...doesn't have the depth perception,sports
It would be kind of funny to experience,sports

"As a Mavs and Dirk fan since 2000, words cannot describe how fortunate we are to have experienced such a man on and off the court! This is truly surreal!",sports
"Dirk is a great, love this guy. Shout out to the Mavs organization as well. Through all the ups and downs I never heard much talk of a trade. You really feel like there is loyalty both ways, despite hearing the opposite frequently now a days. With the way free agency is now I wonder if anyone will spend 21 years with a team again.",sports
fuck man I cant help but to tear up thinking about it. my absolute childhood hero. the NBA is going to be so wierd without him,sports
A farewell to a legend,sports
"Awww, I can’t believe he’s done. Amazing player. I enjoyed watching him play over the years (not to mention, hating on him too 😬). Another era has ended.",sports
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't think of one player besides Dirk who consistently took pay cuts year after year in order to give his team a better shot to sign big name players. Not only was he a fantastic player, he was also a fantastic teammate. Love this man! Greatest PF of all time!",sports
"That championship, through his loyalty, is more meaningful than getting 3 or 4 in 3 or 4 cities. And that career, through his loyalty, is one of the greatest of our lifetimes.

I hope that a lot of the young guys see this, and see what it means to be a legend in a city.",sports
"I've commented this before, but I've grown up with Dirk. Dirk is THE MAN. I will ALWAYS remember him. I remember when it was him, Steve Nash, and Michael Finley. Dirk has been here my entire life, and I love this dude! He is one of the GOATs, and he is a super good guy. Thank you so much Dirk for being such an awesome human being.",sports
"Dirk is my absolute favorite player ever. His iconic high-arching fadeaway and jumper; I practiced and emulated it for years! He's been such a role model to me in basketball. Hope life treats him well for his years to come. 

I also think it would be sweet to have Dirk's knee-up fadeaway as the NBA logo!",sports
Dirk is probably the most loved human being in all of Dallas/FtWorth area.,sports
I have never and will never love an athlete like I love Dirk Nowitzki.,sports
True class act. One of the last true and humble greats of the sport.,sports
This is what LeBron walked away from in Cleveland,sports

Boss,sports
🐐,sports
This almost feels worse than Modano leaving... So happy to be alive to watch him and modano in person and win a championship for the city. I'll never forget Dirk and Jason Terry! One of my favorite combos in NBA,sports
"He’s really one of those exceptional athletes that quietly leads year after year, puts in the work and is simply an excellent teammate. Been watching him for decades. Farewell Dirk!",sports
41.21.1 Dirk Nowitzki🐐,sports
Last team to win before the emergence of the 'Superteams'.,sports
He is the Roger Federer of Basketball...,sports
I’ve been a mavs fan all of my life dirk has always been a class act and a great guy to meet. Hats off to the greatest elbow turn around fade away jumper this game has ever seen weird leg raise and all,sports
He was *always* underappreciated,sports
Man Dirk gone is weird,sports
Thank you Drik for such an amazing and exemplary career. But I want to thank you especially for that 2011 Playoffs run and how you crushed the Heat’s dream after their unfair collusion.,sports
"tearing up. I started like REALLY watching the NBA in 2000 and I had two heroes - Dirk and Vince Carter. this is gonna be so weird not having him out there. He stayed with his team for all those years, never complaining, never blaming anyone for the down times etc. and he won a ring with little to no help. Dirk is top 3 all time PF - absolutely no doubt in my mind.",sports
"MFFL.

Enjoy retirement GOAT!",sports
Let's just be honest he led a Mavericks team to a championship against one of the best teams of all time and didn't so without any other big stars. GOAT,sports
Duncan and Kobe retired the same year and now Dirk and Wade. Shit hurts man.,sports
"Born in Miami, went to high school in Dallas. Dirk ripped my heart out in 11' and I couldn't be happier it was him.",sports
There will never be another Dirk. Not in the NBA. Not in any of the professional sports. Legend.,sports
Im annoyed at all of the hype Wade got today.   Dirk was a better player and a better person.,sports
Well said. Absolute Legend,sports
What was the reason behind the selection of former players speaking on the night?  Kemp is a head-scratcher.,sports
"It’s simple, if Dirk cries I cry.

I’ll never forget the spin around Bosh and lay up he had. Hands down one of my favorite basketball players that didn’t play for a team I liked ever. Such a class act and an all time great. Mavs fans are lucky to have had such a great person and basketball star on their team. Thanks Dirk.",sports
"Thanks for the memories, Dirk.",sports
Damn we will miss that fadeaway shot. Farewell Dirk have a nice and cozy retirement.,sports
"Rumor has it that Dirk is planning to release an album in his retirement

"Dirk started playing for the Mavericks when I was barely one. Now I'm about to turn 22 later this year. I've seen this man play ever since I was 3 or 4, and I've enjoyed seeing him play from beginning to end. Basically, I've not watched the NBA without Dirk Nowitzki. I guess we can't have all of the good things and good people around all the time. 

&#x200B;

But thanks to Dirk for sticking it through for a whole 21 seasons with the Mavericks. He made mine as well as millions of other kids' childhood when we were younger, with his skill and more importantly, his personality off court. A true gem of a human being, I'll definitely miss seeing him play.",sports
Legendary.,sports
The German Moses!,sports
"When did these retirement speeches start? I feel like one of the first ones I saw was Kobe. Basketball gonna have to stop with this emotional stuff. Yesterday it was Dwayne Wade, today we got this... I can't be having all these tear jerk moments in my sports",sports
"I'll never forget his run to beat the Heat, and that flu game that he had. Amazing player.",sports
It's gonna be real weird thinking of the Mavs without Dirk.  That dude has been with them since I was 3 years old.,sports
Only away games for him now,sports
"Dirk changed the landscape of the NBA.  He exemplified team basketball, and showed what loyalty really means.

I don't think anyone will forget the pure will he showed to bring a championship to Dallas.  Hail Dirk!",sports
"He's from the town just over where I was born in Germany. I moved to America when I was 8 years old and even though I'm a Lakers fan, Dirk always was one of my favorite players because I saw this lanky tall German (I'm also 6'5) killing it in America and fitting in and it meant a lot to me I guess.",sports
Dirk was a beast. His fade away was unguardable!,sports
"Loyal old school Kings fan here. Back in the day we hated the Spurs. Loathed the Lakers. But always had respect for Dirk and Nash. Much love, Dirk. You will be missed.",sports
Now he can focus all of his efforts on [captaining his crab fishing boat](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/1976570112/hB752C4CF/),sports
"Shut it down. Let's go home, Dirk. :'(",sports
"He's 41 years old. That means he's been a Maverick longer than he was alive before being a Maverick. All class, all the way to the end. He'll be missed!",sports
"Dirkules. A true Hero,",sports
This is incredible. What a gladiator.,sports
2006 was the year I started really getting into basketball. Crazy how Dirk and Wade are both retiring.,sports
I can’t believe it’s time for him to retire. I remember when he was new to the league and thinking that guy is a freak!  Happy to say he proved me right and remained one of the players who gave everything he had every game. Well done Dirk and thank you for all the amazing memories. Enjoy retirement. You earned it.,sports
It's pretty rare for basketball players to have this much loyalty to their franchise in a league where stars get passed around and white themselves out in free agency,sports
Love you Dirk.,sports
"I was there, we will miss you dirk!",sports
NOW Steph is the nicest guy in the NBA.,sports
Four more years! Four more years!,sports
one of my favorite athletes in the entire world... so glad and so happy that he played his entire career here in DFW... Happy Trails Dirk...  Thanks for the awesome years!!!,sports
Dirk wie ist die Luft dort oben?,sports
legend of the game,sports
He will always be a Dallas Maverick.,sports
No. My understanding though s he could have gone elsewhere for more money but wanted to stay with Indy,sports
"Those Finals against first year Miami big 3, god damnit Dirk",sports
Dirk is one of those guys that is hard to dislike he seems like the nicest dude,sports
I’m not even a Mavs fan Thunder for life but that gave me goosebumps that man is the last of a dying breed staying loyal through the ups and downs I remember playing basketball as a kid and doing a one foot fade and yelling dirk but that man is a legend to the entire nba gotta respect that mans loyalty.,sports
F-ing Legend,sports
I was crying like a baby at this game,sports
**Legend**,sports
Dallas is proud of you Dirk!,sports
Thumbnail looks like he’s spitting bars.,sports
"Dirk is the Roger Federer of the NBA. He may not have the GOAT status like Fed, but he is respected and is simply a very genuine person.",sports
I had so many people convinced his first name is Dirkel.,sports
"Damn, a bunch of my childhood idols are retiring. Kobe a while back, Ichiro, Vince Carter, Dirk...

It's sad to see all time greats having to move on but hopefully they can finally kick back and chill now and not worry about playing hundreds of games every year.",sports
"“Can you sign an autograph for my daughter?”
“What’s her name?”
“Ahhh, Dirk....”",sports
We love dirk!,sports
"Great way to go Dirk.
Have fun in retirement :)",sports
How can you not like sports when there is moments like this? Yea it might just be a game but just imagine how many kids around the world may have been inspired by guys like Dirk. Another great is retiring.,sports
I thought he said a few months back that we was playing next year?,sports
Looking at this without my glasses on made me think this was on 2k thinking they have players saying speeches on the game. 🤦🏾‍♀️,sports
Cries in German,sports
"Mark Cuban blowing up that champ mavs team prematurely will go down in as one of the worst decisions in the history of the sport. Easily wasted dirks prime.

Was he good at making points?,sports
"Legendary talent, super classy guy, a hero for Dallas forever.",sports
Anybody have a link to what mark cuban says after? Itching to hear the follow up,sports
Farewell big man,sports
My hate for Chris Bosh after leaving Toronto for Miami and and Dirk punishing him in the finals made me fall in love with basketball.,sports
Oh fuck he forgot to thank or mention his wife,sports
"A Legend in his own time. A fucking pleasure to watch 

Kinda presumptuous to assume he is getting his jersey retired though /s",sports
The most emotional German,sports
"My brain read the title of this post as ""Nir Zuk's firewall speech after his last home game as a Dallas Maverick""...  I legit sat there looking at it for a few minutes trying to figure out how that made sense.",sports
"Let the man speak.  You make all the noise you want to after.  Before, its forgivable. But once he started, just shut the fuck up and listen to what he has to say.   Annoyed at this type of shit.",sports
Oh so he is retiring,sports
"That seems like an eternity, and yet you still missed a couple of seasons at the start.  Unreal how long he played in Dallas, an unbreakable record",sports
This is how I'm going to feel when Ovechkin retires from the Capitals/NHL,sports
class player all around,sports
I rushed to the closest bar after class so I could watch this game. I was already bummed I didn't get to go the the game (but fortunate enough to be at the one he passed Wilt) then I saw those 5 legends honor Dirk and IMMEDIATELY started tearing up at the Twin Peaks I was at.,sports
"As a Rockets fan since forever, I hate you guys...but not him.  What an incredible career.",sports
"Dirk was/is an always will be one of my favorite ballers ever.  (Lifelong Lakers and Kobe fan).  So much respect for the dude, he hit some of the most ridiculous shots ever witnessed.  Couldn't have been happier about he and the Mavs winning the ship in 2011",sports
Sports fans are so weird.,sports
"Dirk took plenty of pay cuts as he got older too just so he could stay with the Mavs. He didn’t always insist on having a superstar’s salary, he knew it was important for his team to have cap space to get new, young talent. He took pay cut after pay cut to stay with and help his team simply because he cared more about the organization and the community than the money. They don’t make many like him, absolute legend.",sports
"I don't think there is a single basketball player who means more to their franchise than Dirk.  Chicago loves Jordan but they've had other amazing players like Pippen or Rose in his prime.  But for Dallas, they had Dirk.  They've never had any other A+ talent in their history, no other player has led them to a championship.  Dirk will go down as one of the greatest franchise players in any sport.",sports
"Dirk is just a wholesome unselfish person. No player has said anything bad about him (that I know of) and he's highly respected by everyone in the NBA.

The dagger that got me though was seeing him tear up during a video that played last night about his charitable acts. He always insisted that stayed private because he didn't do it for recognition. That was the only time last night you can see him visibly tear up and it happened DURING the game not after lol",sports
"I didn't think I would cry but here I am. God damn it, I love that man. I remember even my grad school profs let us out early so we could watch that Mavs champ run.",sports
If he doesn't get a bronze statue at the AAC we riot!,sports
"also fuck magic johnson for choosing the night multiple NBA legends are supposed to have the spotlight (dirk, wade, frye). he couldn't stand to not have the attention! the lakers failure of a season have been in the news all year. give it a break. he went and told the media too before telling his staff! pathetic

&#x200B;

edit: this is really harsh, i know, just seems like he could've waited a couple days. they aren't in the playoffs anyway! he even did it right before a game",sports
"Dude, seriously. I don't watch NBA games anymore but everyone I enjoyed watching either retired or they're in the process of retiring. It's sad, I'll miss them.",sports
Agreed. Dwyane Wade as well. Watch Wade’s Beer commercial on YouTube. Grab a tissue as well,sports
"Hell yeah, as a spurs fan, I hated him growing up but deep down I was glad he’s a Texan! It’s bittersweet seeing these legends go...",sports
"Duncan. As a Spurs fan, I used to HATE when Duncan and Dirk would match up, cause it would always be a close battle. The year we won the title (2014) we faced each other in the first round and it went to SEVEN GAMES! I truly believe because of that series, everything else became easier. 

Congrats to Dirk for being loyal to Dallas. They don’t make em like that anymore.",sports
Joe Pavelski,sports
KD took a pay cut to be with the warriors,sports
Tom Brady did the same.. imagine which amount of money he could have demand.. and look how many mediocre QB get more then him.,sports

Edit: let me preface that I know nothing about basketball but remember watching it one day and saying to my friend hmm I thought he played for the _____ and my friend saying yeah hes ready to retire and he wanted a chance at a championship.",sports
"Brady, every year.",sports
Brady,sports
I was a tall lanky high schooler. Too skinny to play the low post well. I modeled my game after KG and Dirk. Big men playing 15-20 feet out with fade aways,sports
From Dallas can confirm. love him more than my mom.,sports
KD walked away from it in OKC too. He could have stayed and fought to earn his own title(s) and the city would have loved him forever.,sports
and he made the right choice.,sports
It’s also Cleveland though... And he’ll be a hero there till he dies regardless,sports
"No, Lebron walked away from Dan Gilbert.",sports
"Kobe, Duncan, Iverson, Shaq, Nash, McGrady, Melo, Pierce, Garnett, the 04 Pistons (F those guys).

It feels like D-Wade and Dirk were the last stars of my childhood still playing, and now they're retiring too :(",sports

"Let's look at the 1990 Chicago Bulls and see if they were a superteam:

1. BJ Armstrong - Drafted by Bulls in 1989
2. Horace Grant - Drafted by Bulls in 1987
3. Stacey King - Drafted by Bulls in 1989
4. John Paxson - Drafted by Spurs, Traded to Bulls in 1989
5. Scottie Pippen - Drafted by Seattle, Traded to Bulls in 1987
6. Michael Jordan - Drafted by Bulls in 1984
7. Tony Kukoc  - Drafted by Bulls in 1990


Let's look at the 2015 Golden State Warriors:

1. Steph Curry - Drafted by Warriors in 2009
2. Clay Thompson - Drafted by Warriors in 2011
3. Draymond Green - Drafted by Warriors in 2012
4. Harrison Barnes - Drafted by Warriors in 2012
5. Andre Iguodala - Drafted in 2004 by 76ers, traded to Warriors 2013

If the Warriors were a superteam in 2015, then so were the Chicago Bulls in 1990.

If KD is the reason the Warriors are a superteam, then so was Dennis Rodman for the Bulls.",sports
League has always had superteams.,sports
so threepeat bulls werent a superteam?,sports
"Is he tho? I mean he is a great and class act but, I don’t see the comparison",sports
"Yeah Wade is great, but he did show a lack of character mocking Dirk being sick in the 2011 finals. Dirk showed class and let his play do the talking.",sports
"Well, Dirk and the Mavs got the best of a favored Miami team that featured Wade and Lebron in the 2011 Finals.  His game winning layup in game 2 was so clutch.  One of my favorite NBA Championship runs in my lifetime.  That said, both Wade and Dirk deserve big sendoffs.  Amazing players, both top 50 NBA all-time.",sports
They both deserve respect for their impact on and off the court. Don't turn it into a Dirk v. Wade thing. They both are legends and should be celebrated for their careers.,sports
Bruh why they both legends,sports
He grew up in a small town in Germany. He didn’t get a lot of nba games to watch. He had some on VHS and the SuperSonics happen to be pretty good in the early 90s.,sports
"They played a video package before their introduction of Dirk talking about his greatest influences as a player growing up. And then they brought out his childhood heroes. He said in a press conference after the game that the only one that wasn’t there was MJ. But yeah, Kemp was one of those guys he just admired.",sports
It was the year I quit as I could only see it as a clone of the WWF after those finals.,sports
"He thanked his family, I assume that includes her.",sports
Dirk’s wife and kids are rarely mentioned/shown....he’s a very private person.,sports
Mark Cuban should have walked out on the floor holding a hanger and went ahead and raised the jersey off of his back.,sports
With how often players jump around teams these days it’s incredible he stuck with the mavs his whole career.,sports
"They showed a stat that he's played in 48.3% of every Mavs game that's taken place. Sadly that number will only shrink but still remarkable. Oh and he's had 199 different teammates which sounds like an odd stat but even more remarkable considering he's only played for one team. If Lebron hits that its like meh, he's played for multiple teams so that number jumps by almost 20 each time he goes from one city to another.",sports
"NO, Russian Machine Never Breaks",sports
"I was too young to feel Yzerman's, but can confirm, this is what losing Zetterberg felt like.",sports
"Remember that at one time Ray Bourque left the Bruins.  He went to the Avs and won the Cup.  When he returned to Boston (the city, not the team), he was treated like a hero. Dirk will be treated the same.

I still get emotional seeing the clip of him [changing numbers for Phil Esposito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83FzYJd_vYI) as they retired Phil's number.",sports
"Shhh, were trying to pretend we’re normal!",sports
"Dude has never had an agent, he's always negotiated his contracts himself. I think that's the most underrated reason for why he only played for one team. He really doesn't do commercials or accept endorsement deals, he was always just happy to be playing basketball. 

I think he's the most unique player in NBA history for a number of reasons. The mavs were the worst team ever before he came here, he made a lot of kids (myself included) mavs fans for the first time and we've all stayed that way. I was 13 when he started playing here, and now I'm 34. 

The thing I will miss the most about him is just him always being there, he was the last athlete from my childhood that was still playing. Even when I couldn't watch a game, I always knew it was ok because Dirk would still be there and I could catch the next one. When you go to a game in Dallas, you were going to see the team, but your main reason was Dirk, you were really going to see him.

I can't really put into words how much I've loved watching him all these years, I just know that I'm very emotional today. He was never this big time athlete to this city, he was and will always be one of us.",sports
"> just so he could stay with the Mavs

I respect this so damn much.",sports
"Hell the year they won the championship he was the 12th highest paid player in the league which may not sound bad but players like Rashard Lewis, Michael Redd, and Andrei Kirilenko made more than him. Before this season he signed a new contract as well.",sports
"This is why I respect and regard him as a great. The guy was all about the team! It seems like all the “superstars” nowadays are just chasing dollars. 

I had the privilege of going to my first NBA game recently and I got to see him play.  A memory for sure. 

We love ya Dirk!",sports
"Germans have a different approach to their work than Americans do, and Dirk’s the hallmark of that.",sports

[removed],sports
What's going to be even harder is 10-15 years from now when people that I actually remember getting drafted retire.,sports
Reggie Miller was kind like this for Indianapolis,sports
Fitting that Dirk hangs them up after tonight's game in San Antonio. Those were some colossal battles back in the day.,sports
Ya... I was going to say... Tim Duncan,sports
I will forever compare pro athletes on a sportsmanship/loyalty scale of zero to Duncan. I'm a Wake Forest fan so I was  on board from early on but it's no exaggeration to say that the man is the epitome of the ideal modern sports star,sports

"Huh, I never would have guessed that Dirk never averaged a double-double.",sports
"Duncan considered going to the Magic when the Spurs weren't doing that great for a couple of seasons early in his career, but the Spurs never missed the playoffs . Dirk went through almost 10 seasons of the Mavs steadily declining and still stayed loyal to his team.",sports
Yea but a lot of players do the same in their last year or two - it really isn't the same as giving up money in your prime IMO.,sports
"Yeah, Malone did his last year.",sports
KD has love for another city already in Seattle. They should have never moved the team honestly.,sports
"I still think OKC fucked up hard by trading James Harden instead of Westbrook. Westbrook couldn't stand not being the best player on the team, so his style conflicted with KD.

And there it is! Can't have Lebron and his cavs tenure mentioned without unnecessary Cleveland hate! 


We loved/love him more than any fanbase ever would, and he knew that and still left anyways. He knew how much we appreciated what he brought to the city, and while we all obviously still immortalize him, him leaving the second time definitely put a small damper on everything, especially the whole ""I'm coming home"" thing. He should've stayed...he would've been treated like a god for the rest of his career. In LA he can't even play without their fans chanting ""we want Kobe"" while he's on the floor lmao. The amount of disrespect he gets for that team simply not being that good is ridiculous.

We still have Vince Carter!,sports
"That pistons team is to this day my favorite complete starting 5 for any team in history. Those guys were so fun to watch. 

Chauncy was an unselfish distributer with a trusty jumper. Rip had the drive and the grit to score when he wanted. Tayshaun was an all around competitor who contributed substantially at both ends of the floor. Rasheed had the personality and the attitude fans loved but opponents hated, in addition to his soft touch and ability to score even from 3. And then, my personal favorite. BIG BEN the 6'9"" center who was one of the best defensive players I've ever had the pleasure of watching and one of the most athletic freaks of nature I've ever seen take the court. Hed match up on guys 6 inches taller then him and impose his will. This is not to mention the amazing players they had off the bench as well. 

No true superstar like we have today, but 5 players who worked amazingly well together. The epitome of quality team basketball. All of them had skills and qualities I tried to emulate in my own play style. Hell I remember when I broke my nose in 7th grade I was actually excited because I wanted a Rip Hamilton facemask lol.

"Dirk won rings with JJ Barea and Peja Stojakovic.


Wade needed Shaq, and Lebron/Bosh.",sports
Shawn Kemp was a monster and played with Detlef Schremp on the Sonics. DS was a German hero. Dirk would have seen a lot of Sonics games in the 90’s.,sports

According to Johnson, Simmons just wanted a mentor and there were no implications about future contracts with the Lakers. I think the “I couldnt tweet about Wade or Dirk” was intended to highlight a lot of other things, like the Simmons situation. He wanted to be able to freely work with/wherever he wanted and Buss/the NBA prevented him from doing so",sports

I'm admittedly a Westbrook stan, but I don't think that's true at all. Westbrook just wants to win games, he doesn't care if he's the best player. His style may have conflicted with KD's for other reasons, and the fact that Scott Brooks never ran an actual offense didn't help, but they were still one Patrick Beverly and one Klay Thompson away from titles in 2013 and 2016.",sports
"Dirk will go down as a god among men because of his loyalty. In the hierarchy of DFW legends, there is Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, Roger Staubach, Nolan Ryan, Mike Modano... Everyone who grew up in the Dallas / Fort Worth area has a story about them and many childhood memories of them. All of them are nationally respected, but locally they're legends. Dirk will go down as the greatest of all of them.",sports
"This is the best ELI5 I could think of:

Because we want heroes/main characters for our dramas in sports. 


A player sticking with a single team is like watching a movie trilogy/odyssey being created in real time. The setting is always the same, the drama is the team's, and the victories/losses are shared as we watch a player advance through their career. Think something like Star Wars, six movies in the same universe watching the rise, fall, redemption, and consequences of Anakin Skywalker being one of the most powerful in the universe. The drama here is a multitude of factors that is complex, as not only does the main character influence outcomes but so do outside factors. These factors stay present up until the very end. An easy way to put this is Cuban would be Palpatine and Anakin would be Dirk. They are both there from the start to the end but you get to see how one affected the other and vice versa. 


Players who bounce around are more like a television series in real time. The settings change and the seasons are dramatic story arcs of the main character. Think along the lines of Steve Irwin. You never knew where he'd be next but you knew it'd be exciting because of what he brings to the table. The drama here is normally created by the main character and their actions, they drive the story that you latch onto and enjoy. However, at the end of the day the main character is the story themselves.


All in all, it just comes down to the drama of it. Some people like complex story lines where the owner's and player are there with a surrounding cast outlasting through good and bad decisions. Other people like the episodic nature of other players chasing rings or moving to play with their friends every few years. The drama of building power teams and those guys all liking each other is another example of an episodic drama in Basketball. Where's the next power three going to be and will they win? It all comes down to drama and which version you prefer. You can like them all or like none of them but ultimately, that's the simplest explanation I can come up with.",sports
"It is a job but you don’t need me to tell you it’s not like your average job. Players aren’t obligated to do anything but when you stay at a franchise your whole career like this you become that teams franchise player with love and admiration across your city (or region depending on the team) and fans across the league gain a certain level of respect and admiration for you. After your career is all said and done people will look back on your career in a much more positive light than say a title chaser like Durant. Also, when you stay your whole career with one team you don’t betray your fans. There are countless examples of stars leaving their original team and that fan base despising them from that point on. So, IMO, it’s a combination of this things that make a player like dirk just so loved",sports
why is that wrong? he valued his family and personal life over pure basketball. that's fine.,sports
Grover from Sesame St? Nice...,sports
"Well, and I don't live there, but i've spent weeks upon weeks in hotel lobbys in the Cleveland area, I was under the impression that most people don't really hate him as much for leaving the second time.

"It's pretty awesome. But while I love the mavs, I may not be able to watch for awhile after this, I had a hard time watching the Stars the first year or two after they let Modano go, this may be the same here. I just can't picture the Mavericks without Dirk, he *is* the Dallas Mavericks to me.

I'm still a big Stars fan, but the emotional connection is just not the same without Mo, and with Dirk it's even more emotional because I never watched the Mavs until he came here, I really think he and Cuban saved the team, they probably wouldn't still be here if those guys had not come along when they did.

Not only that, but he broke the curse. I grew up watching the cowboys win super bowls and seeing the stars win the cup. But I was young enough that I didn't really understand how rare it is to win, I didn't realize until I was an adult that sports are primarily going to break your heart every year. I was starting to think that maybe I wouldn't get to see another championship, that the sports gods had given me all of them during my childhood. I had pretty much given up hope at that point, and then Dirk saved us all. A lot of people cried when the Mavs won, myself included. I was just so happy to see another title, and I'm still taking victory laps to this day. But I was also just so happy to see the franchise finally win, and to see Dirk get his ring, I can't think of anyone I've ever wanted to see win more than him.

The older I get, the more I learn to appreciate things. I really can't put into words how much Dirk means to me, I feel very fortunate to have gotten to watch his entire career, and I'm also very sad because it's over and there is now going to be a massive void that can never really be filled.

If there are any young people reading this, just enjoy seeing your heroes play and don't take them for granted, they won't always be there. And when they're done, the same sense of wonder just isn't there when you're grown.",sports

"Wasn't saying loyalty has any effect on being the best at your position.

Roger Staubach will be the greatest to the older folks.

"There really is no flip side though. Dirk averaged 7 ppg and 3 rpg this year, which obviously isn't great but every other year he averaged double figures (except his first season) and at least 5.5 rebounds, he took lower salaries and even pay cuts to try and improve the team, and he led us to championship twice and won the only championship in franchise history.

This is really the pinnacle of a low information opinion. The Heat didn't change many players or their coach. The Cavs fired a rookie head coach and had a mostly bad roster outside of a few players which is why they were always in the lottery. The Lakers have been one of the worst run teams in the league since Kobe's last few years. Also the role players on his teams get paid a ton more than they're worth- see Mozgov and Tristan Thompson's paydays. Lebron up til this year made everyone around him relevant.,sports
"that's only really been the case for his second cleveland stint and on. he didn't have that pull yet his first time in cleveland and was too young to be calling shots like that, and then pat riley largely built the heat beyond the big three.

Only twice in Lebron's career has his head coach been let go while he is on a team- both with the Cavs, both after a considerable amount of time, and both firings instantly led to success. As for the players the amount of roster turnover in the NBA is such that it's a silly thing to blame any single player for.",sports

"Only two coaches were actually fired while Lebron was on a team since 2003 though. You said he was disrupting their lives but both the Heat and Lakers still retain their coaches from before Lebron and the two coaches Lebron left in Cleveland probably would have been fired sooner without him.

The list is going to get longer after this Lakers stay, you have Rondo sitting in the stands every other game. Lebron throwing the ball into the back of the backboard, giving up on defense.. What a great leader.

"Just continual low information talk radio opinions. ""He got swept in the Finals"" after carrying a lottery team through the playoffs twice in 4 seasons. ""Kobe was never swept in the Finals"" because his bad teams didn't make playoff runs.

The idea that Lebron is a Westbrook level stat machine is the ultimate in low information opinions. It's the kind of thing you could only say if you mostly listen to Skip Bayless and never actually watch the sport. Sorry bud- you're not smart.",sports
"I played basketball my entire life from AAU/YBOA to varsity and was a college athlete. I have watched my fair share of basketball. 

It isn't about who is smarter, Lebron isn't the best to play the game, hell he had to have Wade give him his first ship. (I love wade and honestly like Wade more than Lebron) Lebron also doesn't cover the best player on the opposing team. I have watched him a lot.

You don't have to get mad at me because Lebron's career fell apart after he didn't have Wade. Wade in my opinion embodies the Jordan greatness moreso than Lebron.",sports
"You're literally just repeating the same silly shit by wrote to discredit the best player since Jordan.

Wade needed Lebron to win another championship and after Lebron left Miami he went to the Finals another four straight years including two of the best post season performances we have ever seen. Wade is not on the same planet as Lebron.",sports
But why?,sports
Vodka,sports
He obviously dropped his phone.,sports

A lot of people had no interest in mixing politics and sports - here's a guy saying that he's going to keep his politics out of sports.,sports
"Yeah well his politics actually manifested on the football field (albeit before the game starts), which forces football fans to talk about it.",sports
"But he didnt for years,and just made another political statement about San Francisco",sports
"I mean no, it really doesn't.",sports
"Not really

This one is more interesting to me, given that someone who appears to be potentially racist might be drafted into a line of work that is 70% black lol",sports
"Then what was the point of doing it? Don’t you think the whole point was to get people talking about what he was doing and why he was doing it? And using a platform that he knew would give it the most exposure? Or was that all by coincidence? Kaepernick knew it would start conversation, that’s why he did it. That’s my whole point.",sports
"I'm saying you aren't required to have an opinion about it. Clearly he wanted to have a conversation, but if all you want to do is watch football, that's all that was required of you. He didn't need to be invisible for that. Players are trying to be constructive, not merely inflammatory.",sports
I'm pretty sure the Masters isn't a men-only tournament; it's just no woman has ever been good enough to qualify.  A woman could play in the Masters if one ever finished in the top 4 of the US Open or British Open.,sports
"Why would they spend the money on an event no one would watch? Whether you like it or not, womens golf is entirely funded by the mens side of the business because people dont want to watch a lesser product when a better one is available.

&#x200B;

Its why semi pro leagues dont have tv deals.  Im sorry about the sad reality of biology, but women have to understand. The only reason your sport exists in any relevant situation is because the mens side is funding it because womens sports as a whole is unsustainable money wise because the skill is just not there to justify people watching.",sports

I hated the Spurs for a lot of my life but that was pure class by them. Pop is the same way.",sports
"What a guy. I remember back when he beat the Heat and the Big Three, what a series. Gotta love Nowitzki, he really changed the game. Thanks Dirk, we love you",sports
First ballot Hall of Famer. Remember when people said he was soft? Where are those people now?,sports
Dirk was an amazing player. This makes me sad...,sports
"It's funny... I've never been the hugest fan of LeBron, but I was rooting for the Heat in that first Finals against the Mavs, if only so their ""dynasty"" could have a legit start and make things interesting and competitive. Watching Dirk play out of his fucking mind in that series changed my mind and made me a life long fan. Nothing but respect for this guy - have a joyous ride off into that proverbial sunset brother!",sports
"I'm so glad he was able to get a championship with Dallas. 21 years with one team, is there anyone else in American sports that can beat that?",sports
"This is an example of sports at their best. A career. A person dedicated to their team, their city and their fans. So much so that it becomes an inseparable part of their life. Every player who ever walked onto a field, court or rink dreams of moments like this.",sports
"This man has been my hero my whole life, feels like the end of a chapter. Thank you for all the memories Dirk, you will always be the GOAT!",sports
A household name. I don't follow sports but this is touching.,sports
"Dirk was a cheat code on NBA Live 2004

It was hard to miss with him",sports
“Tears of joy” has never been a more important phrase this NBA regular season than now. Goodbye 2000s!,sports
"Love you Dirk. 

Sincerely,

A Heat Fan",sports
One of the best to do it,sports
"I'm not an NBA fan but I was glad when he won a title.

Always seemed to be a class act.",sports

"What a classy move by the Spurs organization, it’s amazing when a player can transcend an in-state rivalry.",sports
Props to the Spurs. Gonna miss Dirk.,sports
"There are only a handful of athletes in the world that were so polarizing and revolutionary that they literally changed their respective sport. 

Dirk was one of those athletes. A true legend. Not only a tremendous talent but a true ambassador for the game. Not even a Mavs fan but going to miss seeing the big man play.",sports
Legend. And I don’t mean that in the bullshit way it’s thrown around today. I mean him and like 7 other people in the universe status. Guy was incredible wire to wire in his career.,sports
I remember that game when Wade and Lebron were mocking Dirk when he was sick. Then he went ham on their asses. What a legend.,sports
True legend... his story speaks for itself,sports
That's what sports are about.,sports
"[Here's the song playing the background for anyone wondering.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahVL4u6rmI) It's the theme from the HBO miniseries ""The Pacific."" Hans motherfucking Zimmer too.",sports
One of the few absolute class acts left in the game. And now there’s one fewer,sports
OH MY GOD MY FUCKING HEART,sports
I did not realize his career FG% is 47%! Holy shit! Dirk played his entire career hitting pretty much half his shots. Legend.,sports
Dirk is a good soul,sports
"""Don't cry because it's over. Be happy because it happened.""",sports
"I've been watching him ever since as a toddler. As a die hard Mavs fan, watching this made me burst into tears. This man IS the Mavericks, and without him we wouldn't have gotten anywhere. Bless Dirk, can't wait to see his massive statue in front of the American Airlines Center",sports
"Amazing player, his hard work and dedication really shows and speaks for itself. When he just joined the NBA he was not even 10% of what he is now. He god damn earned his ring the hard way (not like other superstars that opt to join forces and ""win"" their rings.)",sports
Best European baseball player in history. Dude was on another level,sports
"I never follow sports. Nor really watch.

But I remember being impressed by him and his fade aways. I've always made an effort to watch his games when I could.",sports
It sucks he only got one championship but it being against the most hyped team ever makes up for it.,sports
Stop it. I don’t even like basket ball and I’m tearing up STOP IT,sports
"I love Dirk. Dude's got nothing but passion. The thing I really love about this game (and all sports) is how genuinely different his reaction is from how Kobe's was, or Duncan's, or Jordan's. Where one guy is overcome with emotion, someone else leans into the competition, someone else leans into the team, and someone else leans into the legacy. The whole point is that the game is so personal AND so communal. It's what makes athletics so wonderful and transcendent. It's humanity stripped of all pretense. You get to see people for who they are and it's fucking beautiful.",sports
That man always has true love for the game.,sports
Dirk is just a good dude. I really am proud of him.,sports
One of the most likable personalities in all sports.,sports
"NBA won’t be the same without him. Guy has been such a staple in the NBA for as long as I’ve been alive at least. We’ll miss you, Dirk!",sports
Absolutely love this man. He is the kind of athlete and person you point out to your kids as role models,sports
"I'm from Dallas and have been watching Dirk play since I was an infant. His was the first jersey I ever owned. I remember losing my mind as a kid when he led the Mavs to the championship. I will never forget you, Dirk.",sports
"Dedication to 1 team.

Fuck all that other team hopping bullshit.

This is a real team player.",sports
One of the greatest of all time,sports
Why did they call him a jerk?,sports
Its hard not to love Dirk. What a class act!!,sports
Retiring at 40 sounds awesome but you have to wonder how some of these pros deal with it. You’ve known one thing your whole life and suddenly it’s gone.,sports
Wurzburg To The World!,sports
"I was at the game. Pretty cool to watch him make his last basket and have the entire stadium stand up and cheer, regardless of team affiliation.",sports
"""Jerk Nowitzki!!!"".....that's what I heard.  Did anyone else?",sports
"What a great player. As a long time Laker fan, he has the utmost respect! Glad he had a great career, all things must come to an end.",sports
Dirk > Lebron,sports
Legend.,sports
What’s the song in the background?,sports
Dirk will always be a class act and top power forward. What a career.,sports
Legend and class act,sports
So many tears tonight! Big up to all of them,sports
"The passing of the torch, way to be Dirk....",sports
"I’ve been preparing myself emotionally for his retirement, but it’s so hard to say goodbye.  I know he’ll always be around the game and that makes me happy. What makes me sad is that my daughter will never grow up watching him play like I did.",sports
"I'm a Spurs fan, but I have nothing except respect for Dirk. Amazing player and hell of a guy",sports
"A legend within the state of Texas. Didn't matter how poorly the Mavs played, we always spoke about Dirk and his greatness. To us Texans, Dirk is the next best thing next to Jesus.



Also, the soundtrack used is the main theme from the HBO mini-series ""The Pacific"" (great series, highly recommend watching it). Hans Zimmer - Honor.",sports
I remember Don Nelson saying when Dirk was drafted that Dirk would revolutionize the game and be in if the all time greats.  Everybody thought he has lost his mind.  Looks like Old Man Nelson knew a little something about basketball.,sports
I remember idolizing this guy as a kid. Great guy. Great player.,sports
Second best power forward of the 2000s. His performances in the 2011 finals against the Miami Heat super team was one of my favorites.,sports
I love that man. Greatest person/athlete that’s come through our town. So grateful to have been able to watch him  since I was a kid. I’m going to miss it a ton.,sports
"As a German, there are very few rolemodels like him!",sports
Grew up a big Houston rockets fan and literally hated him. Called him Dirk the jerk. Who knew I’d get nostalgic watching him retire.,sports
"There are electronic billboards here in San Antonio which say ""Thank you, Dirk!""",sports
Farewell dirk. There won’t be any more like you. Thank you for helping so many enjoy the game. And beating the heat;),sports
Definitely a class act and a generational player that will be talked about for decades to come,sports
One of the greatest to ever play.  Thanks for the eurostep.,sports
Unhateable,sports
"""Let me tell you about Dirk. He's the nicest man ever."" Charles Barkley.",sports
Dirk Nowitzki really loved the game.,sports
I've never heard anything but positive things about this guy. Hell of a player. I hope he has a well deserved happy retirement.,sports
"One of my favorite Players all time hands down. As a Laker fan, I just want to say I love you Dirk, thanks for all the years of great basketball and unselfishness. Set the bar for a lot of European talent and you can see that rubbing off on all of the younger dudes coming into the league now.",sports
Still so happy he and the Mavs beat the Heat and he got a title.,sports
This makes me proud to be a spurs fan,sports
"Not a Mavs fan but watched Dirk since I was a kid.

Sad day, but so happy I got to see him. If anyone doesnt dont know, this man is fire with a basketball, the first 7ft big man to do it like he did it, one of the best rebounders of his era for many years, and always a reliable threat on offense from anywhere on the floor in every game.

Truly a legend. We have been so lucky.",sports
And then...there was Vince Carter.,sports
Holy shit. That is the most genuine emotion I have ever seen. This is overwhelming to watch for me. So much going on there. Just wow..,sports
One of my favorites. I'll never forget Dirks championship run that was one of the best playoff performances I've ever witnessed.,sports
I was there.  He wasn't the only one crying.,sports
Brb also crying.. plus I’m getting old!,sports
"I'm not from a country that cares particularly much about basketball, but everything I've seen about Nowitzki tells me he's a class act",sports
"Dirk is such a class act. I remember as a teenager an episode of Punk'd where they tried to punk Dirk by sending some random kid over to his lunch table in a restaurant to ask for an autograph. Dirk happily signed an autograph for him and the kid comes back 10 minutes later with a shit load of swag for Dirk to sign. So anyway Dirk, being the stud that he is, signed it all for him no questions asked. Finally the guy eating lunch with Dirk (whose in on the gag) has to goat Dirk into getting annoyed just so they can try to get a rise out of him and Dirk just keeps saying ""he's just a kid man"". If I remember correctly I think the kid had to come back a third time with a garbage bag full of stuff before Dirk finally calls the kid out. I don't remember a single episode of that show but that one has stuck with me all these years",sports
Dirk is a legend where I live. Kinda teared up a little watching this. We love you Dirk!!,sports
"Dirk loves the game, and the game loves Dirk",sports
"Best European player in the NBA of all-time, no? Not trying to be hyperbolic. He’s a great regardless, just curious if there’s anyone else to really consider. I don’t think it’s close.",sports
"I remember being HEAVILY biased for the Heat in the 2011 playoffs. I wanted to ser Lebron win that ring so bad. Looking back, I wish I wasn't. That Mavs team swept the Lakers & beat OKC w/ Harden, Russell & Durant. I didn't realize it at that time, but I had witnessed a player solidify his legacy as the best player his team has ever seen by winning them their first championship against a super team w/ 3 of the best players who came out of, arguably, the best NBA draft ever.

So much respect for that man.",sports
"Pro baller to pro bawler. What a legend this man is though, hope he enjoys retirement",sports
"Bit hard to understand players getting emotional over stepping away from something most people can only consider a hobby.  Then you realize that he's spent half of his life in the NBA and he's basically saying goodbye to the only thing he knows.  If I gave up my mundane lifelong hobbies, I'd probably break down as well.

Good luck to him.",sports
"I love you, Dirk!",sports
"Don’t know the man. Hell, don’t know the sport. But a man with money on his mind doesn’t cry when the jig is up. Hope that someday Passion will drive us all as much.",sports
It's been an honor sir...,sports
I’m really going to miss the gentle giant.,sports
hug the damn guy,sports
Only OG mav fans remember the days when he played with Steve Nash and Michael Finley.,sports
I’m a die hard Lakers fan and cried when Kobe retired. Can’t imagine dealing with that. One of the greatest to ever play. He comes with the heat.,sports
The Nba will never see a rainbow three as sweet as Dirks again.,sports
"If someone put him on their all time top 5 NBA team, I may not agree with them, but I couldn’t argue against it.",sports
Dirk is a generational player top 15 or so of all time. He is a true legend and will always be one of my favorite players.,sports
"He’s the greatest maverick of all time. It’s not even close. Good dude all around. Highlight of my life as a fan was game 6 of the championship against the Heat. I was in Vegas at the time. Put 500 bucks on them to win. Thanks, Dirk! Won the money, won the championship, and shut up the three, rude dickheads in lebron Heat jerseys.",sports
"Not even a Mavs fan but Dirk has always been one of my favorite players. In this age were alot of these stars are divas Dirk has always been a team first guy. Him beating the heat in their first year as the big three, will always been an awesome series and upset. Glad he got a ring",sports
Legend 💪🏻,sports
"If anyone deserves a farewell tour amongst the crop of prima-donnas of 2000s, its him. A wonderful loyal player who was humble and driven.",sports
I can't believe the schedulers didn't make Dirk and Wade's last games at home.  Why are they both playing away?  I get that scheduling is complicated but at least one of them should've been able to finish at home.,sports
"I’m not crying, you’re crying!",sports
"Why is the announcer saying ""Jerk Nowitski?""",sports
"I find it odd that some people on here feel like they are shocked that the Spurs organization would do something like this.  Also, as a Spurs fan, I've never had anything but respect for Dirk.  Now, Mark Cuban has said some shitty things about our city in the past and tried to turn it from a sports rivalry to a city hating rivalry, and for that I fucking can't stand Mark Cuban and because of that I dislike the organization as a whole, but Dirk, Dirk is all class all the time.",sports
"I’m from Dallas and a Mavericks fan but despite my bias, Dirk is truly one of a kind. There is no other player like Dirk nor will there ever be.",sports
"I hate WATCHING basketball or any sport for that matter, but it's people like this that make me love the game!",sports
"""You played the game the right way"" from one of my idol to another. Such a touching movement. 33 --> 41",sports
Am I the only one who hears JERK NOWITZKI,sports
The Dallas cowboys used to be called America’s team. Well Dirk’s America’s MVP. You’ll be missed,sports
There goes my childhood with him! Way to go Dirk! Such a great player,sports
Nash+Derk= best combo ever,sports
Best PF of all time,sports
I like this announcer’s slow morph into Paul Heyman,sports
"I don't watch basketball but I love you Dirk, you 7'0"" softie.",sports
It’s a terrible day for rain,sports
Did they forget to mute the The Pacific theme?,sports
Does an audience/teammate reaction like this make someone second guess their decision to leave? I ask a someone who will never experience this kind of feeling because not enough people care if I exist.,sports
Dirk always has been and always will be my favorite NBA player.,sports
What sucks is I personally stopped paying attention to basketball after the Jordan era Bulls disbanded. I've missed the last 25 years of basketball. Just reading these comments and seeing him and his reaction to this hair he wasn't too sit on YouTube binge watching his highlights. I'll check back...,sports
"If I had the career he had, the love from all his fans, and the check book he has then yes, I’d be crying to on my last game. Love Dirk.",sports
"Ugh man this just hurts my soul. Such an amazing player, and a true class act on and off the court. We will miss you Dirk.",sports

"As a diehard Spurs fan, the I-35 rivalry was something real and fun to look forward to in the days of Tim, Tony, and Manu vs Dirk. Dirk broke my heart too many times with his super ultra mega clutch 4th quarter shooting. Sad day in sports :(",sports
"That is awesome and emotional, but I think the respect Doc showed Dirk earlier this year was more meaningful. Seeing as it was an away game for the Mavs and he stopped the game to do it. Pretty awesome moment here. https://mobile.twitter.com/NickVanExit/status/1100273351384272896",sports

"First Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett, then Kobe Bryant, Paul Pierce, now Dirk and Wade. Melo is out of the league, Dwight Howard had a rough year, CP3 and LeBron are nearing their ends as well. The GOATS of the 2000’s for me. Man the NBA of many of our childhoods really has hit its end.",sports
Thank you for everything you’ve done Dirk. Especially being my go to fantasy draft pick in every NBA 2K game I’ve played. Honor to watch such a historical figure in my lifetime,sports

One of the greats. Maybe most responsible for today's game.,sports
Wade and Nowitzki having the last games of their careers on the same night. Just yesterday I remember them winning finals in their prime. I’m glad I was able to see those guys along with Duncan and Kobe run the league in their primes. All respect to the legends,sports
"I collected nba jerseys as a kid in the mid 2000s my dad tried to only get jerseys from guys he thought would stay with the team till he retired so my jersey always seemed current. Had a Jason Richardson, Paul Pierce, Jason Kidd and a Dirk jersey. Crazy only one of them stayed with their team. I at least have one jersey that will last a lifetime. Thanks dirk!!",sports
You’d think after all these years he’d be used to being introduced.,sports
I have been a fan of Dirk for the past 20 years.  There will never be another who will replace him in Dallas.  He is a living legend.,sports

"Dirk is the Bro of all Bros.


There is zero things you can find to dislike him.  

It's rare in this day of age.

GG brotha",sports
Damn I got chills!!,sports
"I’m going to miss him, he was one of the good ones",sports
I hate sports but see all your love for the dude and hits me in the feels. 😭♥️,sports
"Keep in mind that this reaction is after a tribute video from perhaps his biggest rival in San Antonio. When an opponent gives you a tribute video, that's how you know you've made an impact on the league.",sports
Steve Nash crying too. 😭,sports
You're no dirk in my book Dirk.,sports
My favorite German finally giving it up.,sports
Damn...,sports
"Nice shot winning the finals in 2011 Dirk, was really happy for you.",sports
Legend.,sports
Lol playing the pacific intro theme will surely inspire everyone,sports
I used to eat dinner with him because my grandparents lived right next to him. That's cool. He also made sure that we'd get free cards for his next game,sports
Moments like this are what it’s all about. It’s what makes it all so Goddamn compelling.,sports
What is the song name?,sports
Aww it's rough to see him so sad and no one around him gives him a hug! Must be tough to be a guy :(,sports
The epitome of class.,sports
"I was there, awesome experience. Spurs are a classy club.",sports
NBA champion Dirk Nowitzki,sports
Who the fuck is cutting onions in here?,sports
"I remember when he kicked a stationary bike on his way into the locker room.  Oh, those were the days.",sports
pussy,sports
I used to abuse a glitch move in NBA 2006 where dirk had a specialty move where he’d make every 3 pointer he took. My brother hated me for it,sports
"For anyone wondering, here's the [music] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P47yvI7SWM)",sports
"I love my Spurs for doing this! Such a classy organization, and I’m glad to call myself a life long Spurs fan!",sports
A great player with an really really great personality!,sports
I’m crying too,sports
When Dirk cries we all cry.,sports
Wait... was this bad of brothers?,sports
Good bye sweet prince,sports
This stuff hits home...,sports
Love me some disco Dirk!  Amazing career!  Still remember that post season freethrow streak that was insane for a big man!,sports
Ohhh my heart.,sports
Dudes a baller with a long career. It must feel crazy knowing that this huge part of your life is just over now. Always liked him even though I was most often rooting against him.,sports
Got em with the music.,sports
Yes,sports
Dirk has been playing since I was born... this is crazy and saddening to me and my friends. He will forever be a legend. Thank you for what you’ve done Dirk.,sports
That Pacific music!,sports
Can we just  take a pause though? 7’4!? He’s literally two feet taller than me! That’s ridiculous.  I’m not really that short honestly,sports
Band of brothers theme,sports
SOMEONE HUG THAT MAN!!!,sports
What a gun player.,sports
One of the greatest german sports man ever,sports
Someone give that man a hug!,sports
Thanks for all the memories DIRK,sports
Moments like these define the true spirit of the game... Did you cry too while watching this video??,sports
We’ll miss you Dirk.,sports
"He didnt have to call him a jerk, what's that announcers problem?",sports
"Man I hope this is Lillard with the Blazers in 10+ years. Of course in a perfect world, with a ring too.",sports
"Must be nice to have a job/career that makes you cry uncontrollably when you retire from it. I know that there is a very high likelihood that if I continue down the career path that I've chosen I will very unlikely experience anything like what he did. More than likely I'll be ecstatic and saying ""So long suckers!""",sports
Wow just make me cry then.,sports
Damn it I'm gonna miss that beautiful jumper,sports
"From a Spurs fan, much respect.",sports
Sounds like the announcer said JERK Nowitzkiiii,sports
A living legend!,sports
GOAT! 🐐,sports
"It’s an amazing time to be an NBA fan, to be blessed with these amazing athletes who are great role models on and off the court. 

Dirk forever.",sports
Goat 🐐,sports
One of the hardest-earned rings in NBA history,sports
Legend of the game. It's something special seeing a man like this cry,sports
Truly a player everybody loves!,sports
It made me cry. Damn I am to emotional.,sports
He also cries when I plow his ho with my hog.,sports
Right in the feels. This video will probably send me chills for the following years. “DIRK NOWITZKIIIII!!!!”,sports
Class.  I saw him play his first game in Portland and remember him as a talented really young guy.  What a career.,sports
Fadeway Dirk first ballot hall of famer,sports
"It’s so crazy watching these guys hang it up, we’re watching some of the greatest players to ever play. Retire. Just like when Lebron retires. Even the ppl that dislike him, will see how different the nba is. Same with NFL and Tb12. 

Watching the greats that you grew up watching retire. Is tough. You may see them here or there every once in awhile. But you can’t watch them every single night for months out of the year.",sports
Dirk is the man!,sports
Thanks Dirk if it wasn't for you I'd never had picked up a basketball!,sports
"Can confirm, I live in DFW

Dirk - thanks for the memories!",sports
"I remeber that episode of punked where a kid, about 9 years old let him sign stuff for him to put on ebay. Nowitzki visibly irritated just kept signing away. Gentle Giant, guys just got a great personality",sports
Thank you dirk for all the years you put into the sport. Watching the 2011 series was magical seeing you play your heart out.,sports
Loved his fade away! Stopped wathcing nba after he won the ring.,sports
Beautiful.,sports
Will never forget his performance in the finals against Miami. I was rooting for Miami bc I'm a Lebron fan but when I saw the effort he was putting in I actually started rooting for the Mavs.,sports
Dirk paved the way for all the big guys shooting from deep these days.,sports
"I like wholesome cries. They always get me going right on with em whenever I see one lol. As a Spurs fan you don't like the Mavs, and you didn't always like Dirk, but there's always been love for him. And I think that the whole league would agree with that. Its crazy to see such an NBA icon play his final game man. But everyone gets old, and Dirk made the most of his career. Absolute 1st ballot HOFer. Glad to say I was able to watch him play.",sports
DIRK!,sports
DÖRK,sports
Absolutely one of the best ever. Maybe the best ever white player and almost definitely the best ever foreigner.,sports
"I was at this game with my old college roommate. He is a lifelong Mavs fan, I’m a lifelong Spurs fan. 

Two grown men crying. Two wives patting on our backs.

Spurs fans were so respective of our German I-35 rival for over two decades. 

Thanks to Dirk for being a one franchise team like my Robinson, Duncan, and Ginobili.",sports
"I've adored you my entire existence. Congrats Dirk. From Philly, we love you.",sports
You gotta love him,sports
"I’m not crying, you are!!!! 😭😭😭",sports
"No one has said it yet, dirk for governor or senator? PULL A SHWARZZANAGER! (guessing on the spelling).",sports
Best wishes Dirk. Glad he got that title that one year.,sports
Lakers fan here. Dirk played his heart out in the 2011 playoffs when he beat the Lakers. I couldn’t believe that happened but Dirk deserved it. What a baller.,sports
CLASS fucking ACT!!!,sports
"His Jersey Number is 41.

He's also turning 41 this year.",sports
Bester Mann!,sports
What a damn legend.,sports
Man I remember crying after I played my last competitive hockey game in high school. I couldn't imagine what hanging up the shoes feels like for a future hall of famer in any sports feels like.,sports
I’m not an emotional guy or follow basket-ball but I felt his emotion on another level seing him like that,sports
"Not a mavs fan, but I actually cried",sports
I’m so proud of Pops and the Spurs. I love how classy the organization is and I really admire the respect from the team to their opponents.,sports
My man.,sports
"Wade is gonna go down in the history book a whole lot better then Dirk, but low key Dirk proved you can with with teamwork and loyalty. He means so much to the international bball community and to the Mavs/NBA. First KG, the Duncan, then Dirk. The of spot gonna be sad now.",sports
It must be so difficult having to let go of something you love so much.,sports
"Wait, did the announcer call him “Jerk” Nowitzki?",sports
I don't watch basketball but I can relate to such a big change. Crying was appropriate as fuck and I wish him luck in his future endeavors.,sports
" 
Q",sports
Legend.,sports
I'm in a gay relationship with my father.,sports
I bet Marc Cuban cried too,sports
"As a Canadian Basketball fan, I was truly pissed when Nash lost his third MVP to Dirk.  

Then I started to learn about the player. 

If I thought Nash was a class act, Dirk taught the program. How wrong I was, to argue against the best (sorry Ginobili) European player ever to grace the NBA. 

While Kobe's last game hit me real hard, Dirk's is as close to the perfect walk into the sunset ending as I could have imagined.

Thank you, and all the best in your future Dirk.",sports
"That's what you got for being old :P

Edit; this is meant it be a joke, also I don't watch NBA so I just presume he has retired because of he's age?",sports
u/vredditshare,sports
"Oh, come on. He's only crying cause I'm crying.",sports
"And not a single one of those little snots on his team could be bothered to show some respect for him. Seriously, look at them.",sports
Man those fadeaway shots. I think thats what its called (not a big basketball fan hut i know who the biggest ballers are),sports
John Nowitzki?,sports
"As a lifelong Spurs fan, the Mavs/Spurs rivalry was so good natured and real. My childhood was filled with watching their games with my mom and grandpa, and those are memories I'll hold onto as long as I can. Duncan may have been my favorite player, but I fuckin love this guy. o7",sports
Legend. How can you not love that man?,sports
Really enjoying the theme song to “The Pacific” here haha,sports
I hated Dirk many times -spurs fan,sports
Such a class act. A very humble player which many players of today may want to emulate.,sports
As a mavs fan im really going to miss him. So glad he is going out with so much praise though. The farewells are very sweet.,sports
Legend!!,sports
Nowitzki is the man,sports
Reminds me of Ichiro's last game (which I attended). A legend with class who everyone respects.,sports
"What a fuckin' pain in the ass this guy is. I'm from Houston and this guy shows up in motherfucking Dallas just about the time we Houston people are starting to realize the magic of the 1994 and 1995 Rockets isn't coming back. 

Props/respect to the man.",sports
"He makes me proud to be a German. It's not so PC to say that, but it's the truth.",sports
"German Moses, love him",sports
Dirk earned all the accolades he received. He has been a class act in and out of the NBA. As a proud mavericks fan we will miss Dirk. Enjoy your retirement you have earned it.,sports
Isn’t that the song from The Pacific,sports
"Always a class act, even if you hate the team you cant hate Dirk.",sports
The guy is a legend and that's hard to say as a rockets fan. He's killed us for so long,sports
Nothing screams raw emotions like seeing a 7 foot tall grown ass man crying like a child. There cannot be another player to swish the way he did. Will miss you Dirk!,sports
A true athlete and a great person. All the best in future life...,sports
" The tradition of big guys in Texas is astonishing and has been handled beautifully by Dirk in the last few seasons. A Dirk-less floor just means we’ll see him enshrined in the HOF sooner where he belongs alongside his Texas brethren of Hakeem, Yao, Duncan and Robinson.",sports
Can you even imagine all the pain and effort into his passion that leads up to this? It's incredible what these athletes  go through. Just inspiring. Well deserved man.,sports
"Why does it seem like he was the first big man that could shoot the three? Also, that fade away... Jesus.",sports
"I wish my dad was still around to see this, he loved the Mavericks and everything about Dallas. Hell he's the reason I love players like Nowitzki, Ryan, and Romo. Seeing them retire brings tears to my eyes, long live Dallas.",sports
Ehrenmann,sports
I’m actually really sad right now hearing this :( he was truly one of the greats!,sports
Love,sports
"We love you Dirk, Dallas loves you, the whole state of Texas loves you.",sports
Hug that man. He needs a hug!,sports
I just joined in...,sports
Excellent use of the Band Of Brothers soundtrack. That music is SOOOOO emotional to me,sports
"Great player. One of my favorites, and I don't even watch basketball.",sports
"I always get confused about posts like this that get platinum, gold, and silver. Like why do people give someone essentially reporting content a reward. They've just clipped a video.",sports
I remember watching the game when he lost his tooth. Jeez I feel old.,sports
As a heat fan. 2011 still has a lot of salt over it. But gg,sports
Chills literal chills,sports
"Pretty surreal when (imo) the 3rd greatest PF of all-time and the 3rd greatest SG of all time both have their last home games in the city and with the teams they built up on their backs and carried to championships. Neither Dirk nor Wade were my favorite players growing up, but goddamn were they professionals in every sense of the word and we were lucky to have witnessed their greatness.",sports
He’s so great. I rooted for him hard when he won the championship. You can tell how much he loves the game. Wears his gear on his sleeve and I love him for it.,sports
"There have been a couple different faces of the NBA during Dirk's career, but he has been the the heart and soul of the NBA for 2 decades now.",sports
Absolute legend,sports
The pacific theme song just makes everything so much more emotional... thank you Dirk for some of the greatest moments in NBA history,sports
How can someone dislike sports?,sports
Didn't other people tell him to retire?  Like he wasn't 100% sure until people started saying it?,sports
My first NBA jersey and my first favorite basketball player when I was in middle school in the early 2000s. Loved Dirk and remember cheering out of my mind when he won his championship.,sports
Streamable link?,sports
This is why we play.,sports
He’s so great. I rooted for him hard when he won the championship. You can tell how much he loves the game. Wears his heart on his sleeve and I love him for it.,sports
What does passion for what you do look like?  This.,sports
Good to see a man letting his emotions show.,sports
Dirka dirka,sports
I wonder if he has a lot of notoriety in Germany as well or just well known stateside.  Is he a paid spokesman or in major ad campaigns etc,sports
"Did I hear the theme music for ""The Pacific""?...",sports
Giant (both literally and figuratuvely),sports
Is no one gonna give this man a hug or even a pat on the back!?!,sports
That would have been crappy had he gotten the usually road team intro in that low monotone voice. At forward 7 feet from Germany Dirk Novvitski,sports
That's just... reDirkulous,sports
"Not for nothing, why does every stadium play cheeeeeeeeze whiz music every time they do something like this? 

I just wanna hear the people!",sports
Is that the Band of Brothers soundtrack? Powerful,sports
Thank you Dirk,sports
"Did the PA say ""Jerk"" not ""Dirk?"" That was weird",sports
"Lol, they played the background music to a song for a show about Americans fighting Germans in WWII.",sports
"Im german and Dirk is the only Basketball player I know. (Except Michael Jordan maybe).

I never knew that he was that famous in the USA or really celebrated. I always thought of him as just another pro player in the american Basketball league and nothing really super special.",sports
I’m not crying! Onions I guess......,sports
"As a Spurs fan, I feel Dallas pain. I also feel my pain from the many daggers Dirk has plunged into our playoff hopes in seasons past. I was genuinely happy for him when they beat the Lebron Heat for his first championship. He has been the generational heart and soul of that team for many fans. Duncan wouldn’t be the great that he is without opponents like Dirk. Without the defeats he was handed. Man that ‘03 series. Brent Barry. Whew. We paid for that karma when Ray Allen 2013’d us. I still cry.",sports
"Dirk, Wade and Gronk still all have years left in the tank. Shit I’m 22 and feel old seeing them all retire",sports
"Man, I had a feeling this would be his last season, but nothing prepares you for this moment. What a role model and Dallas Mavs legend!",sports
"yep, i cried",sports
"The year was 2005. European basketball championship final between Germany and Greece. It was played in Belgrade, Serbia. Serbia loves Greece and Greek people but that night the whole arena chanted Dirk MVP. Germany lost, but Dirk won the MVP award and the crowd continued to chant MVP. Dirk is such a loveable player and I have nothing but mad respect for him. Thank you Dirk!",sports
"Come on, y’all, HUG THE MAN! Lol.",sports
He is a hero here in Dallas,sports
Why did he leave?,sports
He was my favorite player growing up. God bless Dirk!,sports
I like that they added the theme from the Pacific into this.,sports
Can't believe he was still playing. Stopped watching basketball quite a few years back and felt like he was a veteran already back then. Class.,sports
An absolute fucking legend,sports
Thanks Dirk! One of the greatest!,sports
Who's chopping onions?,sports
"I saw this post with 41.0k upvotes...Dirk will go down as a once in a generation player. He’s always been on the Mavs since I’ve remembered and he will be greatly missed. Luckily he left the Mavs in good hands!

[41k upvotes](https://share.icloud.com/photos/08MJ6Ch9waOW3ZRjxey4ejg5w#Home)",sports
One of the greatest.,sports
"The era of a player and club sticking by each other for their full career is over.

There is so little loyalty from both sides now that the only thing the teams and players care about is money.",sports
Paul Pierce comparing his stats to Dirk's to see if he can tweet about him being better.,sports
#NotTheOnions,sports
"Dirty Dirk, you're my all time favorite player!",sports
Just came to be a part of the post. This man deserves every bit of good praise.,sports
Bulls fan here... And I am teary eyed..,sports
D Wade and Dirk both done after this year. NBA won't be the same without them,sports
My husband went to their home game against the Timberwolves last week and he was so glad he was able to see Dirk play before retiring. Such a bittersweet moment!!,sports
It's crazy to think this guy has spent more than half of his life playing pro ball in the best league in the world.,sports
One of the best step back jumpers in the game. Never saw anyone really defend it well.,sports
Something about seeing a grown man cry always hits me in the feels..,sports
"havoo...havoo, havoo...",sports
"Great player, great man",sports
 a whole legend!,sports
"His best moment was beating lebron, it warmed my heart and so does this 👏",sports
"Dirk is a real one. Such a dynamic player and a genuinely good guy. Don't know a single Mavs fan here in Ohio, but EVERY basketball fan I know is a Dirk fan.",sports
Did it by himself—no super team,sports
I remember when he was on Punk’d.  Really makes me realize how long he’s been around.,sports
What a dude.,sports
That The Pacific soundtrack tho,sports
"Im not crying, you're crying",sports
Take er easy big fella!!,sports
San Antonio gave him a standing ovation.,sports
Great Man,sports
I'm from Chicago and I respect this guy. Legend for sure.,sports
Class act,sports
Man that guy looks like he needed a hug.,sports
Damn. He was balling back when I still liked basketball. Nothing but respect for him. Solid guy.,sports
Dirk was playing when i first realized basketball existed. We're 15 years past that point.,sports
I've listened to this three times. Did that dude say jerk Instead of Dirk!,sports
It sounded like they said jerk,sports
"Wow, ya never really see The Pacific themed used for moments like this. Underrated score",sports
Him beating the heat was one of my favorite finals ever. There’s a lot of Lebron fans and NY and they were immediately writing Dallas off.  Dirk was a legend to me from that point on. The game won’t be the same without him.,sports
"He was my favorite player growing up. 

Still is a classy guy.",sports
"Such a beautiful moment, being able to retire when he decided. Blessed.",sports
One of the greatest Milwaukee Bucks players of all time.,sports
https://youtu.be/VU6UHBYJOUw,sports
curious as to the music playing in. the background.. anyone know what it is?,sports
Speculation time - What’s dirk gonna do now? Going to stay in Dallas? Move to Germany? Become an analyst? Anyone have any thoughts?,sports
F,sports
"there's no crying in Baseball.

You get off easy this time, Dirk.",sports
What a lil bitch! /s,sports
Someone who was standing next to him should have giving him a big hug.,sports
Teared up a little 😢,sports
SOMEONE GIVE THE MAN A HUG,sports
I'm not crying you're crying. Such a class act always.,sports
I'm gonna miss him so much.,sports
Dirk is so great. He is in commercials in Germany and I could watch them all day. He just seems so pure and nice,sports
"He’s a good man, loved watching him play.",sports
There’s no crying in baseball.,sports
"I’m not crying, You’re crying!! 😭😭😭",sports
I hope Dennis Schröder (who is from my old hometown) will rise to the same -or similar- heights. He's also a standup guy like Dirk - he used his money to buy the local basketball club and save them from bankruptcy.,sports
"Poor fella, it tough to leave the game you love.",sports
Yuh,sports
"Dirk has been in the mavs for about as long as I’ve been alive,or at least old enough to like basketball,this is a hell of a loss for Dallas",sports
Love you Dirk. One of the G.O.A.T ❤️🙏🏼,sports
"GG Dirk

Was that Paul Heyman making that announcement?",sports
"I watched this game live.

Sad to see such a great player leaving, all the best to Dirk and his future.

Been watching his NBA games since his first NBA game back then.",sports
The white LeBron killer,sports
"Never knew it was pronounced ""Jerk Nowitski"".",sports
All the goats are retiring,sports
"As a german this is really touching. I was never into basketball at all and as many of you know, the sport isn't really as big as football (soccer) in europe. But even then Dirk has always been a legend to us. Everyone knows his name even if they don't follow the sport - by joining the NBA he made an entire nation proud. I remember the first couple years after I was born (I was born the year he signed with the Mavericks) people on the news and in the newspaper were talking about him all the time, always praising him and talking so highly about him. Even to this day he still appears on many TV ads pretty frequently. I bet you that whoever german you ask if they know the name Dirk Nowitzki they will answer with yes, in every age range. He is a legend and an idol to every young sports enthusiast who's goal it is to make it in that industry.",sports
"I was lucky enough to go to the game and it was a great send off. The two men next to me started to tear up when they showed Dirk crying after the tribute video. Post game everyone started chanting “thank you, Dirk!” 

Shit. I’m crying all over again.",sports
I confess I am a Texan and I LOVE DIRK.... what a class act,sports
Do you think he will be in the hall of fame? s/,sports
That's my GOAT!!,sports
We will miss you dirk,sports
uhh did he say Jerk?,sports
I hope they didn’t play that horrible cinematic music while he was announced.,sports
I don't blame him I would be emotional too! Good luck to ya Dirk you had a good run!,sports
"Dirk has one of the most beautiful jumpshots man, so pure, the mechanics, the arc. One of my all-time favorites, and one of the all-time greats (duh). Salute to you, sir.",sports
"My dad was a rather reserved architect, who was big about his tastes. Basketball was one of them. If I ever came into my parents bedroom to hang out with him, Dirk was usually on TV. He called him The Machine, because his consistent shooting. He passed away in 2015, but I can still hear him cheering on Dirk.

Thank you, Dirk, for the warm memories you gave me with my dad.",sports
"I took my brother in law (huge Dallas fan) to the Spurs game last night. I was so great to cheer for Dirk along side my bro for one last time. I’m a big time Spurs fan, but last night I was with the whole arena clapping and rooting for Dirk. I’m very glad he had a warm send off in his last game. The whole arena stayed and clapped after the game was over chanting “Thank You Dirk”",sports
damn that band of brothers theme really does it in,sports
k,sports
Thanks Dirk!,sports
"Love it, Dirk is a world class athlete, teammate, and person.

I do need to point out, isn’t that the music from the intro to The Pacific (HBO)?",sports
"one of my favorite players. Enjoy retirement, Dirk",sports
They just had to play the the theme from The Pacific in the background too didn’t they. Tears,sports
Hahaha what a cry baby! Am i rite guys???!? Guys??,sports
His ring is worth more than lebron's 3 rings.,sports
"Dirk also cries when he listens to David Hasselhoff albums on the sad songs, so take this with a grain of salt. /s

Dirk is a great guy and a great player, he is the new great white hope and basically this generations Larry Bird. Well done.",sports
"Weird.... Crying after a long and successful career is shocking.... Actually it isn't at all, the guy is a class act.",sports
Take dat witchuuuuu!!!!,sports
Pussy,sports
Jerk Nowitzki is basically the king of Dallas now.,sports
Nothing wrong with crying. Anyone who demeans for it is the scum of the earth or a republican.,sports
"Everyone is commending the send off by San Antonio, but did the PA announcer not just call him “Jerk Nowitzski”.
Wow, Dirk got punked!",sports
I’m guessing the spurs didn’t make it into the playoffs? Why is this his last game?,sports
"More like Dork Nowitzki 
/s",sports
This is what happens when you let feminists take over,sports
Jerk Nowitzki,sports
His face is pretty red. Are we sure he didn't just eat a ghost pepper right before?,sports
ALL SPORTS ARE SHIT.,sports
One ring in 20 years. Whack.,sports
Pussy,sports
Wow what a baby..,sports
Didn’t he retire like5 years ago?,sports
Who is this and why should i care? A millionaire crying aww poor baby.,sports
lol pussy,sports
What a crybaby.,sports
Hes crying cause he won't be making easy millions running up and down a flat open room with other grown men.,sports
Dirk Nowitzki still played basketball? I thought this dude retired years ago.,sports
What a baby,sports
What a fucking baby.,sports

thank you,sports
Just checking out my flair,sports
yeet?,sports
How do cry like a man,sports
Bang,sports
I’m working down the street from the arena. Hell of a turnout for Dirk. All of Texas loves him.,sports
This makes it way better thank you. Wish they had kept the crowd noise in instead of that inspirational music.,sports
"I don't watch the NBA anymore. And when I did the Spurs were public enemy #1, but goddamn do I respect them for this. Very classy send off.

Dirk was incredible.",sports
"I watched the video and teared up. What a genuinely standup guy - on and off the court. As someone from Dallas who grew up watching him, I cannot imagine Mavericks basketball without him. His loyalty, his drive, and his ability to give so much of himself to this sport is truly remarkable. He has forever changed the franchise and the city. It’s going to be weird watching games from next season without the tall baller from Germany out there in blue / white.

Very classy move by the Spurs organization. I’m so glad Dirk is getting his due from around the League. For a long time, I used to feel like he was SO underrated. The respect he’s been getting truly makes my little fan girl heart happy.",sports
What’s it like being the rare breed that hates the Spurs?,sports
That legit made me tear up. Love that dude. All of Texas does.,sports
"Despite any animosity towards the Spurs, one can't deny that they've really got a hell of a great organization. Popovich has been the whitest old dude to be right almost 100% of the time when it comes to anything of any importance. Tim Duncon, Manu Ginobli, and Tony Parker were all non-flashy oldschool ballers who played the right way, much as Dirk did. Fucking sad to see that end of an era end with Dirk. :(",sports
"When the opposite team puts up a tribute video you know you are one amazing person/player. One thing is that whole arena gives a standing ovation but to give you a tribute video....

Respect to the Spurs",sports
"Holy shit San Antonio. Wouldn't they be the Mavs biggest rivals too?

Well done.",sports
"I’ve been a Spurs fan for a long time and have always hated the Mavs. That said, Dirk was a hell of a player and deserved everything he achieved in his career. Thank you, Dirk.",sports
"Spurs lifer here. Nothing but respect for Dirk after all these years. I have a soft spot for Wade and Bosh after the Miami big 3 vs Spurs era, but the Dirk respect is next level.",sports
Chills.,sports
"Did you see the video where Pop was trying to tell his defender to back off of Dirk, so Dirk could shoot? And the guy didn’t, Dirk still made it 😂",sports
Which team do you like I'm a Spurs fan so I'm wondering why you hate them,sports
"I was wondering. I know the post last night said it was his last home game. So awesome of them to do that for an away team player, no matter who it is.",sports
That's so cool!,sports
"And here I was, wondering what Tottenham had to do with any of this",sports
That was super wholesome. Thanks for sharing the link,sports
Wow - classy send off for a classy player.,sports
That shit almost made me cry and i have never watched a full game of proffesional basketball in my life,sports
You gotta love the spurs for doing something like that,sports
I’m a pistons fan and will never forget game 7 in 2005 but the spurs seem like a really hard team to hate. They’ve always done it the right way.,sports
Now I'm crying!,sports
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCTytryWeNk

Beautiful.",sports
This is way better than anything Budweiser can put together.,sports
That MMA intro was awesome.,sports
Ehhh pop has justttt a little bit of cocksucker in him,sports
...did he accidentally say Jerk Nowitzki?,sports
"A true man of class and influence for the NBA. Next up, the HoF.",sports
One of the greatest performances I've ever seen. I still think about that series and not even a Mavs or Heat fan.,sports
"Not a Mavs fan nor do I hate the Heat but if the Heat had won that series and Dirk never got a ring I'd be so upset.

He stuck with the Mavs and did it the right way and the Heat bought a super team to get theirs.",sports
"Once of the best Championships I remember watching. As a Spurs fan, Dirk has been my favorite competition. Gonna miss the dude.",sports
That series was incredible. Like the last Big to take over a series and win it.,sports
The game (game 3?) he had the flu was fucking amazing.,sports
Still remember when he stormed off the court after winning that series because of emotions. Man had me tearing in middle of bdubs.,sports
"That guy would not be denied that series, I remember where I was game 4 (5?) when he willed the comeback and shot absolute lights out.",sports
"Yeah Dirk is the god damn man, I also love how Jason Terry got a tattoo of the championship trophy on his arm BEFORE that season started.. BOLD",sports
"Honestly, the modern NBA doesnt exist without him. The only person who may have had more of an effect on what actually happens on the court. LeBron has changed free agency but this guy changed the game.",sports
"I love that series, first one I saw all the games of and fell in love with Dirk and those amazing rainbow shots. My wife and I were in Berlin that summer and got a Nowitzki Jersey there that I still love dearly.",sports
I lost my mind during that series and I'll.nebee forget it just like I'll never forget him.,sports
"There was like a sport science short on his fade away shots. Apparently his angle was so deep it made it difficult to block.

Really happy this dude won a playoff.",sports
"As the legend goes, he hasn’t missed a free throw since that series.",sports
"Dirty Dirk,  you tha man.",sports
one of the best moments of my young adulthood. I was a naive little boy and thought Lebron might not ever win a ship. ringless Lebron was fun while it lasted :/,sports
Don’t forget sweeping the Lakers!,sports
How did he change the game?,sports
REAL MAN RIGHT THERE,sports
It was Jason terry having the series of a lifetime and LeBron having his worst finals performance in all 9 of his finals appearances  that got them that chip but yeah.,sports
"This is what I like about Dirk the most.  They called him soft because he didn't bang the boards and throw elbows like 7 footers were suppose to do.  They stopped calling him soft because he redefined the position of power forward.  


He didn't prove the naysayers wrong.  He changed their concept of the game.",sports
He is above a first ballot HOFer. He is one of the GOAT big men.,sports
I learned this week that Dirk is 5th all-time in defensive rebounds. That's oppo-soft for sure.,sports
Obviously they’re in the minor burn unit...,sports
Pepperidge Farm remembers!,sports
He's crying like a little bitch in the video. Soft as fuck.,sports
Shouldn’t be sad. It’s celebrating his career and contributions.,sports
[deleted],sports
"Oh man. I grew up watching Dirk, but I was more happy for his and his career and his longevity up until now.

You saying ""Dirk ***was*** an amazing player"" actually drove it home for me. Now I'm sad too :-(",sports
"Not only that but also an incredible guy in real life, met him once here in Germany, awesome guy!",sports
But money buys happiness... Right?,sports
Dirk played through the transition from dial-up. Just saying.,sports
"This made him a hero. As a life long Dallas resident, that will be the pinnacle of the Mavs franchise. Him singing we are the champions, so awful yet so beautiful.",sports
"I'll never forget that series. Dirk went up against a team of what was supposed to be the best players at their positions, a team that was supposed to be unbeatable and outplayed all of them. That shit's what dreams are made of.",sports
As a Dallas kid I’ve been a Dirk fan for my entire life he’s the best ever for what he’s done on and off the court. He can never be replaced.,sports
"Same exact situation and feelings. He was A Cut Above the Rest, a freak athlete who we may never see the likes of again. He could absolutely do at all and at 7 foot tall",sports
"I absolutely love DWade and he's the reason why I'm so much into the NBA today. But even in spite of all their matchups and their somehow perfectly aligned storyline, I could never hate Dirk. He's just so fun to watch and seeing him play is so enjoyable. 

It's been an emotional 2 days for me with these guys retiring. I'm gonna miss Dirk a lot.",sports
Mavs got cheated out of those 2006 finals. Glad we were able to get redemption in 2011.,sports
"I lost a lot of respect for LeBron and DWade when they made fun of Dirk for playing in a finals game while being very ill. Dirk is a class act.

https://youtu.be/LoOXKha7uL4",sports
That series win was also due to LeBron's greatest shitting of the bed in NBA finals history. Dude scored 8pts in one of the games... 2 of them off a flop.,sports
He's a God in Dallas.  Source:. Live in Dallas,sports
And he was sick as a dog as well,sports
"yeah i remember when i was really into basketball i really liked him and the Mavericks, even tho i live near Toronto lol he was just so great to watch",sports
100% did the same thing when they played the Blazers that year.,sports
Yep,sports
"Yeah man same here, haha couldn’t agree more.",sports
Hijacking to ask if anyone has a link to a good highlight video?,sports
"During this series LeBron and Dwayne were laughing at and making fun of Dirk for something, I forget. That run he made was incredible and was so glad to watch those two lose after acting like that.",sports
"I'm a Heat fan, I got love for D. Wade all day.

But watching ANYONE play their heart out is great, and Dirk was always a competitor. One of the well ever see, and I look forward to watching his highlight reels for a long time.",sports
Out of his mind indeed. I don't think I've ever seen such an impressive performance. It was like watching someone play using the cheat codes.,sports
"He basically single handedly defeated the OG big 3.  I've never seen someone shoot like that.  Gonna miss ya Dirk, thank you for everything.",sports
"Right now I‘m proud to be german, because of him! What a legend and what a legendary career!",sports
I was rooting for the Mavs to avenge their 2006 loss to the Heat. They let Dwyane Wade run rampant all over them that first time. I was happy for Dirk and company when they got revenge in 2011. LeBron losing just made it a tiny bit sweeter.,sports
"Being from Cleveland, I fully adopted “The Mavaliers” for that series. I’ve loved Dirk ever since. Lebron may be better all around but Dirk has always been a class act.",sports
"I was a fan of LeBron and wanted him to be on a team that won championships, but I was just as much a fan of Dirk. When that Finals came around, it's one of the few times where I wanted both teams to win.

Guys like Dirk, who are basically the lone All Star for years, I can root for when they are competing for titles. Its an underdog mentality and that I can generally root for. Otherwise, you get what happens with most stars on shitty teams/franchises, they get frustrated after a decade and move on. Same goes for when he lost vs Wade in the Finals..Wade or Dirk winning would have been ok with me.",sports

Why can't you just say sports?",sports
"Besides being one of the nicest guys in the world, and a superstar that avoids the media and self promoting his “brand”, he came to a foreign country as a teenager and didn’t believe himself that he could play in the NBA at that time.  The true meaning of humble.  He is a  legendary gym rat that (when healthy) is the first and last one at the gym/court.  And he has worked with the same coach from high school to his 21st season in the league.   And he is his own agent, signing team friendly deals leaving an estimated 60 million on the table.  

Reading though this thread everyone has mentioned stats and talent and skill and size.   

There are many more reasons why he is beloved here in Dallas that I don’t know if they are well known outside of D.   It makes me super happy that he got to have a mini farewell tour even though he never asked for or wanted it.  He is an amazing super star and I’m not ashamed to sports cry the last couple of nights",sports
I am heavily saddened that someone actually downvoted this comment,sports
"Same here. What people don't realize, he gave up millions of dollars on several occasions. All in the hope of winning a title. The 2010-2011 season payed off by him not being paid. It's beautiful",sports
"They're probably just downvoting the GOAT portion of it. How can you downvote someone who says something so positive?

Oh wait, it's Reddit. Nvm",sports
"This comment is for everyone who didn’t know Dirk before this, including myself.",sports
He was a real cheat code in the NBA in 2004.,sports
I played one of the newer ones with my brother (maybe like 2 years ago) and Porzingis is the new cheat code,sports
Him and vince,sports
"It’s gonna be easy to miss him, though",sports
Even now his one leg fadaway is a cheat code. KD has been doing a great job using this shot. I only wish Steve Nash was with him on his championship run. Their pick&roll were absolutely amazing.,sports
Hey there's still Vince!,sports
I loved seeing the league give props to Dirk and Wade during the All-Star game.  They both had incredible careers.,sports
"Seconded

That’s what it was!! I was thinking band of brothers!,sports

So glad this got a shout. Man that song is instant tears for me.,sports
"I don’t know why, but I made this song my alarm in the morning lol I have very somber mornings.",sports
Came here searching for this comment. I'm rewatching the Pacific right now so this was extra funny.,sports
They also played it when the Spurs retired Manu's jersey.,sports
"I wish they had kept the crowd noise though, that would’ve really brought it to another level.",sports
lul NBA Teams use it all the time,sports
"Yeah but the Spurs are super classy like that. And I mean, seriously, fuck them in the ass for beating the hell out of Dallas so many times, fuck. Goddamn it. But they are a world class org and I'd vote for pop for governor.",sports
Any team would have shown him this respect but I'm glad his last game was with the Spurs.,sports
Dirk was polarizing? I have not seen many people hate him.,sports
"Euro finesse player, and a big guy that scored from the outside. He was truly revolutionary.",sports
"Couldn't upvote this enough. What opposites.
Wade and LeBron all pretend personality. Dirk all character. Such a throwback, in an Era of LeBron and Kim Kardashian..",sports
"Dirk is seriously a legend, I’ve never heard a bad story about him. Super humble, student of the game, all around respectable dude we will miss your Dirk! I hope he finds an announcing gig, at least something that keeps him on TV.",sports
This and the Band of Brothers theme gets me emotional every time I hear it.,sports
"And thats even after the last 2 seasons too, could been even higher",sports
"And a member of the 50-40-90 club!  

He also just this week surpassed 10,000 defensive rebounds to put him at #5 all time.",sports
a good soul player definitely.,sports
Facts,sports
I think we think it's sad because it is so unlikely to repeat. If only the NBA was made up of dirks.,sports
"Yeah Jordan joining forces with Pippen and Rodman for his rings is disgusting.  
Kobe and Shaq teaming up was awful.   
Bird, Parish and McHale working together was truly deplorable.  
Even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar needed Magic Johnson and James Worthy to win a championship. How pathetic.    
Bill Russell had 4 other Hall Of Famers and a Hall of Fame coach when he won 11 championships, what a loser.",sports
It was real classy until the end and then ya mucked it up.,sports

I'm not sure what it's called but it's the theme to the show The Pacific. It's a miniseries based on a few marine's stories from WWII. Highly recommend.,sports

"I watched the whole series drunk at a pool bar, but even I remember how great it was.",sports

By quite a margin I would think. Giannis could be right on his heels though,sports
"Tony Parker? Lol, no jk. Dirk is the fucking man.",sports

You’re not the only one that hears that now..,sports

"Definitely a threatening duo, if just for having to deal with two *wicked* shooters (one being an annoyingly feisty PG and the other being a giant methodical shot-dropper).

Man, as a MAVS fan back in the day (don't even really watch NBA anymore) - I was always bummed the Nash/Finley/Nowitzki combo never made it all the way.",sports
"I don't remember too much of a pre-Dirk NBA and I grew up in Dallas in the late 80s and lived here most of my life. I'd say I'm the biggest Dirk fan alive. But he's not the greatest PF all time. Top 5. He revolutionized the game like no other big in NBA history, but I'd (*weeping*) definitely put Duncan ahead of him.",sports
"Dirk is probably a top 3 power forward, but Duncan and Malone were both better. Dirk was better offensively, and IMO has the most unguardable shot of all time. 

Having said that, Duncan was absolutely dominate in every facet of the game. He easily could’ve averaged 30 ppg, but he played how he was asked to offensively and won rings because of it. 

Malone was very much the same way. That guy had a motor that is seldom seen by a big man. 

I seriously love Dirk and how his game transformed the NBa, but if I were building a team, I would take Duncan over Dirk in a heartbeat. I would take dirk as one of my 12 players though.

Too many people are too young to make a fair assessment.",sports
Slow down there lol,sports
Lmao Duncan and Malone blow him out of the water.,sports

"Spurs pre-2013/14 were very hated actually. Boring, dirty basketball. Bruce Bowen one of the dirtiest ever. Also one of the most successful teams while not being fun to watch. Tony Parker was very hateable. They flipped a switch those 13/14’ finals and played a lot like the 7 seconds or less suns to beat the heat. That 2014 finals is some of the most beautiful team basketball ever played. Really changed and got more likeable as they got older and they didn’t win all the damn time. 

Think what people think of the patriots, except take out the fact that most non-Bostonians hate Boston teams. That’s a lot of the same why the spurs were hated.",sports
Most people used to hate the spurs due to dirty players like Bruce Bowen and their boring play style. They’re only liked today because of coach Pop and they beat the Heat in the finals.,sports
My favorite moment from last night. Pop is class.,sports
I’m a MFFL. That rivalry was deep and very tough some years. But those Mavs/Spurs playoffs were some of the best series of a decade.,sports

I am not even a basketball fan since the 90's(bitter Chicagoan here) and I even really enjoyed the series against the Heat.,sports
me too. that flu game THO,sports
"2004 Pistons vs Lakers.

Lakers had 4 Hall of Famers (Shaq, Karl Malone, Gary Payton, Kobe) and a Hall of Fame coach (Phil Jackson) ... Pistons had a team who might have no memorable names outside of their own fanbase had they not won. Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, Rasheed Wallace but another HOF coach, Larry Brown.

It was a stunning underdog win to see them handle that stacked LA team in 5 games.",sports
Game 2 is the best championship series game I will ever see. Never gonna forget that triple Dirk hit near the EOR to tie it after they were down 22pts. Unreal.,sports
"Not to be pedantic, but the heat didn't ""buy"" their team. The Nets and Lakers had a higher payroll in the 2012-13 season. NBA has a Max contract for players, so the 3 great players they had would have been worth more than the max, but they teamed up with a bunch of vets on minimum contracts and formed the first modern age super team. It was the start of players controlling their own destiny in the NBA, which I perceive as a good thing.",sports
"In 06 the criminal referees made sure that happened.  Gladly,  it didn't dissuade him from going back and locking it down in 11.",sports
Nothing wrong with buying a team. You need a very competent front office to attract big stars (unless you're the Lakers). You can bet your ass the Mavs would max LeBron if he wanted to go to Dallas,sports
"I'm sorry but there is no ""right way"" in the modern NBA and I say that as a massive OKC/Russell Westbrook fan who loves the fact that he stayed with us. 

These players are people with their own hopes and aspirations, a common one being to win a championship. At the end of the day it's not golf. It's a team sport, no matter how good you are, if your team isnt great you can't make that happen. 

While Dirk had an amazing finals run, he was also accompanied by Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Cory Brewer, Tyson Chandler, and Peja Stojakovic. He was able to win because of the cast that was built around him that played to his strengths. 

Meanwhile you look at the Cavs 09 roster and who's LeBron have? A 38 year old Shaq, Antwan Jameson, and Jamario Moon, who, and I'm not kidding, was literally a Harlem Globetrotter.

So it isnt just an individual's ability to be great. A great player might have 30, 40, or even 50 points in a game, but theres still another 70ish points that need to be scored. It's about what the organization they're in puts around a player. 

The mavs are an example of a good organization that recruited great free agents to support their star. The Cavs are an example of a bad organization that wasted years of LeBrons 20's surrounding him with some of the worst talent available. Great players get credit, but teams win championships. So sometimes players have to leave bad organizations to find better ones. And I dont think theres anything in that worth criticizing.",sports
That Mavs team also had a lot of free agents on it,sports
Lol the Heat beat the Mavericks in the finals in 2006 without Lebron or Bosh,sports
"he was one the first mobile 7 footers that can shoot. Now if you look around the league, there aren't many true ""big men"" that can't shoot like there used to be. He changed that, albeit not single handedly.",sports
"He’s a 7 foot dude from Germany. Everybody expected him - as they expected all other players like him - to just play right under the hoop looking for easy lay ups and battle for rebounds, but Dirk was one of the first big guys who started to shoot from further out, going for 3’s and midrange jumpers so that people couldn’t just play back till he drove for the net. He became a different type of threat, and changed the possibilities of offensive basketball because of it",sports
"Best Euro-Player to ever do it.  Go watch some of his highlights.

Proved how dominant a stretch 4 could be.",sports
dirk's one legged step back was.... nah IS killer and iconic,sports
"Buddy got down voted for asking a question, ouch",sports
"Before him no other international player could play in the NBA. But he broke through those walls and said ""Neigh, I vill play in de NBA"" and so he did. The great Dirk played.",sports
"Holy shit 13 downvotes in 3 minutes for asking a question? A person who doesn’t even follow sports wants to know how he changed the game and people are mad at you for not knowing, wtf Reddit",sports
"I don’t know if he was the first, but he really solidified the advantage of the stretch forward.",sports
Why are you being downvoted so much? I’m just as curious as you are. I watched some basketball growing up so I know who he is but I didn’t know why he’s so important either. I appreciate those who answered your question,sports
"Big men did not move away from the basket before him. They were big, slow, and could not shoot from distance. He was fast, agile,  a bulls eye shooter, and 7 feet tall. Big guys couldn't stay with him. Small guys couldn't stop him or block his shot. He was truly the first of his kind. To top it off he was just plain a great and humble guy. Now the league is full of stretch 4's. He literally changed the way the game is played. To top it off, he played 21 years with the same team, 6th all time in points scored, and in the top ten in tons of other measurables. A true unicorn.",sports
"He created a signature midrange shot that was mostly unguardable due to his 7 foot height and angle of his fall-away shot.

One of the most accurate shots ever and many other players adopted some variation of the distinct one legged signature mid ranger in their own skill sets.",sports
"After he beat the Heat, no one called him soft anymore.  The man went supernova in that series",sports
"What, young Dirk use to take it to the hole hard from the elbow",sports
"They called him soft because he was nice, and mainly, white. He wouldn't respond to people getting in his face or shoving him. He also was not a good passer earlier in his career. An aggressive double team made him look ""soft"" because he would turn it over at big moments.  It was a different era, people overvalued the tough act.",sports
"Being young when he started, him being so big and having a great off-the-backboard jump shot absolutely blew my mind. I played basketball as a kid and because I got taller quicker than most I played power forward and I wanted to play like him. I wasn’t a throwing elbows and super physical player. He was one of my key inspirations on how to play.",sports
Dirk had a tooth knocked out one game and kept playing. Dude always go hard. Went to see him play so many games and have a big regret that I didn’t fork over the cash to see him play this season or the last game.,sports
easy first ballot. all time greatest bigs and easily the greatest euro to play in the nba,sports
"He was the first Big Guy that could shoot. He was nailing 3's in the finals back when 3's actually meant something and nobody thought someone taller than 6'7"" could shoot a 3.",sports
Greatest 7ft shooter clearly,sports
Sad because I won't be able to watch him anymore. I hope he starts announcing,sports
"Sad because I honestly feel that the org threw away the last 8 years trying to to just rebuild after busting up the championship team.

I know Dirk didn't want to he part of a rebuilding team but the last half decade has been excruciating to watch.",sports
Better to have loved and lost than to cry over spilt milk,sports
"You know what they meant, ass wipe.",sports
Not to mention he spent all 21 seasons with the same team. We may never see a player of his talent do that again.,sports
"Prime Dirk was a different beast. People remember his championship run as one of if not the greatest of all time considering he was the sole “star” on that team, which is extremely rare in the NBA, especially recently. He was unstoppable for a good 5-8 years.",sports
Dirk only averaged around 15 shots a game too. Crazy,sports
"Both are good. 
Statistically Dirk beats Wade in most areas. But - Wade has Dirk on assists and championships. That’s attributed to Wade feeding the likes of Lebron, ~~Kobe~~, Shaq... Hard not to get assists and trophies with that cast!

More importantly Dirk and crew took down that crookedly assembled Heat team in 2011. The same team that mocked Dirk’s chest cold and then lost to a team led by Dirk. Best championship ever.  Wade has more championships but - Dirk is THE champion.

Edit:  scratched Kobe out. Bosh is the one I was thinking of but they are not at all interchangeable. No clue what I was thinking. Dirk is still best",sports

"He could not do it all but what he did do, mid range knee up spin jumper with that high release was unguardable. Up there with the Kareem sky hook and Tim Duncan bank shot as one of the best shots ever.",sports
What about Tim Duncan,sports
Like Durant except slower,sports
"He wasn't a freak athlete. Giannis is, so is Westbrook. He was extremely skilled and had a wide moveset though. One of the best offensive players ever",sports
"Dirk is very good. Absolutely, but you use words that are just wrong. Durant is a monster, and very much on the same level. As well as having no real height on record, and is very much 6’11 or 7’0 based on comparisons when next to other players.",sports

Dirk was a real trailblazer when it comes to internationalizing the NBA. He's gone on to have the most time spent with 1 team in the NBA.  I was curious how his 21 years with the Mavs compares with other athletes who had lengthy careers with one team in the US.,sports
"Fellow P1 here. Great username mate. Agree with everything you just said. It's the end of an amazing chapter for Dirk, the Mavs, and Dallas.",sports
"He left an estimated 194 million on the table, actually!",sports
"There is this story mark cuban told in an interview. Dug it out again, so I'll just paste it here!  


 

""In an interview with Brown and Scoop on CBS Radio's Play.it, Cuban revealed that the Mavericks' negotiations with Nowitzki were not exactly ordinary. Nowitzki said one number, and Cuban went higher. Eventually, the contract was for even more than what they agreed on -- Cuban essentially gave Nowitzki all the money the team could without going into the luxury tax: $25 million this coming season, with a team option for $25 million in 2017-18.

""Dirk wasn't even in the country and people couldn't even reach him when free agency started,"" Cuban said. ""I basically told him, look, you tell me the price and it actually started lower. His agent said, 'How about this much?' and we said, 'We'll have a little more money, we'll give you more,' and as the numbers started getting bigger and bigger, it was like, 'What about this number? We'll give you more.' Finally, it was like, 'This is what we got left, take it!'""",sports
Agree completely.  He could have bailed on Dallas when they blew up the team after the championship and no one would have faulted him for it.  Instead he stuck around and played the role Carlisle wanted him to and never complained publicly about minutes or pay or anything like that. He could have chased another ring. He's a true professional and Dallas needs to put his jersey in the rafters ASAP.,sports
"I'm a Pistons fan, not a Mavs fan, and I've been unabashedly crying at the thought of Dirk retiring for like a month, it feels like. He's yours, but man does he transcend. Everything you could wish for in an athlete to represent your city.",sports

"It would be hard to relay exactly what he means to this generation of basketball and I'm not even a fan of the Mavericks. He will go down as an all time GREAT and it will probably be a while before we see the consistency and longevity that we saw during Dirk's career. 

I'm pushin' 30 and have followed basketball for mostly all my life but Dirk has been killin' teams since I can remember. 20+ seasons in the NBA. Incredible.

Then he was good but not great. Then he was great but you couldn’t build a team around him. He was labeled as not clutch enough after the 2006 finals loss. He was gonna be an NBA hall of famer with no rings. Then 2011 happened and the story has flipped. People forget how much disrespect Dirk got pre 2011.",sports
History talent/style of play and the way in which Donny Nelson employed him was revolutionary which was itself polarizing across the NBA landscape for probably the first 10 years of his career.,sports
"I don't remember people being put off by his personality, but there were more fans than not that thought he was overrated and not even a good player, much less a legitimate all-star.  


He changed the how people play his position over the course of his career, so people today don't easily remember how dismissive fans were of his game.  People wanted to slot him as a center who had to play power forward  because he wasn't physical enough.  They thought Detlef Schrempf's career was Dirk's absolute upper-bound.  


I can't really think of any other athlete who for the first 8 years of his career or so was seen as nothing more than a decent player and retired with fans unanimously agreeing that he is one of the GOATs.",sports

Consider how many years the announcers would downplay or outright ignore the Spurs, as well as refs (looking at you Crawford, you dirty fuck) shitting on them. All in good conversation, btw.

">2004 Pistons vs Lakers.

The main reason why I don't think of that series as much is because the Lakers were clearly feuding big time with one another. Primarily shaq and Kobe as it got worse by the time the finals came around. 

I love Kobe, but god did he sacrifice some post season wins due to team issues and with the media. The other one that comes to mind is that series with Phoenix.",sports
"I never said they were the highest payroll or the only team trying to buy a championship.

The point was more about how Dirk never left, stuck through the hard times and finally got his ring the ""right"" way, not that there's a wrong way. It's just the wording I used.

Maybe I should have said the old fashioned way? I might be a little retarded, give me a break.",sports

Legends Gary Payton  and Karl Malone came thru, hoping for a ring, too. Mind you, Phil Jackson with Shaq, Kobe and Derrick Fisher had already won 3 years straight, 2000-2002. The team was stacked and they fell apart after losing in the finals, but that was definitely the ""first modern age super team"". They just didn't last long enough to get a ring (with the full superstar lineup) the way the Heat did. The Lakers still went on to win 2 more rings before Kobe finally wore out. The 2004 dream team was long gone by then, though.",sports
"Agreed. I'm moving to Florida from Kansas next week. I'm allowed to live where I want and work where I want. They sign contracts and once those contracts are up they have the right to choose.

"Uh what..this was the start of NBA players controlling their own destiny? What does that even mean? NBA players have been free to take less money and ring chase for a long time now. 

The two ways you can ""buy"" a team are paying exorbitant amounts for players, or paying players less than they deserve. The Heat chose the later and this is what people are obviously referring too when they say the Heat and Lebron bought their superteams. Personally I think the removal of any sort of competitive intrigue/parity from the game and players being pressured to take less money is a bad thing, but hey I guess we're just different. 

It also annoys people when they watch their team try to build through traditional methods and another team just lucks out and has a perrennial Finals contender land in their laps.",sports

"> While Dirk had an amazing finals run, he was also accompanied by Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Cory Brewer, Tyson Chandler, and Peja Stojakovic. He was able to win because of the cast that was built around him that played to his strengths.

Every time.  Every damn time.  Sorry, this is a pet peeve of mine.  People refer to the Mavs '11 run then go listing off teammates proving they don't actually know anything about the team.  Corey Brewer played 4 minutes total in the NBA finals.  FOUR!  He was at the end of the bench.  Listing him like he made a contribution is ridiculous.  Peja was also a non-factor in the finals.

I don't disagree with your point.  The Cavs wasted Lebron's early years, but when you say why the Mavs were good you need to be emphasizing players like JJ Barea and not Peja.  Otherwise, you just come off as someone who looked up the stats for the series after the fact.  And yeah, I'm gatekeeping a bit, but this shit happens over and over in r/nba and it's tedious.

"> Thank you! Everyone seems to ignore that wade and LeBron mocked him. I was so happy they lost.

Pretty sure based on the upvotes, many people are not ignoring this. But they should ignore it. 

Dirk's starting lineup featured a rapist (DeShawn Stevenson) and a wife beater (Kidd). These are two of the worst crimes committed by NBA players in the history of the sport.

Stevenson: http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/12/sports/sp-nbanotes12

Kidd: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/09/AR2007010901592.html

But no, let's focus on a 5 second clip of two guys coughing.

The bottom-line: Your outrage about this is fake. Are people really that upset about this? A 5 second lip of two guys coughing? Meanwhile, cheering each time a wife beater and a rapist make a shot?

It just doesn't add up. Your outrage couldn't possibly be real.

These professional athletes, whether it's Dirk, Wade, LeBron or anyone else--they all play through a ton of physical pain. Name your favorite player. Name your least favorite player. Go to the championship game of your local rec team. You'll find someone who's played through immense pain. Whether it's the flu, a broken bone, or some other pain that doesn't even have symptoms. LeBron has ""played through the flu"" a dozen times. These gusy play 100+ games a year, if you include the playoffs. They're bound to have played at least a couple games through pain. 

Literally every other player on the Mavs was asked about it, and not a single one cared nearly as much as random Internet commenters: http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2011/06/11/setting-the-record-straight-on-cough-gate/

How this all gets portrayed all depends on the media climate. And the media climate, especially the social media climate, in June 2011, was hating on every little misstep LeBron and his teammates made.

Stop falling trap to the headlines. And please, celebrate Dirk, but if you're going to express outrage, focus it on the team that featured a rapist and a wife beater.",sports

"Probably a little bit of both. Players like Porzingis and Jokic have gone on record saying that Dirk was a huge inspiration for them, he was basically the European MJ after he took down the Heat in the 2011 Finals. Everyone knew who he was and changed the perception that bigs just had to play in the post and rebound, everyone was scared of Dirk’s fade-away jumper because it hardly seemed to miss.",sports
European basketball is played with a lot more finesse than American basketball. That means the big men tend to do a lot less banging inside the paint and a lot more shooting. Dirk was one of the first superstar big men to play that style in the NBA.,sports
I think the human body is evolving too and athletes have better information to maximize performance which means big men are more athletic now than before. I think you are right too in that tall players are training to shoot more. Back in the day if you were 7 foot in high school you would just be in the paint all day. The culture nowadays is to maximize performance.,sports
Bigs are training to shoot now. That skill doesn't just happen over night. It takes probably hundreds of thousands of shots to shoot as good as they do consistently,sports
"Yeah, so let’s say you’re playing a friend and he basically only has one shot - a lay up. Past that, he’s a weak shooter. But man, if he gets close to the backboard, you’re doomed. Obviously, you’re gonna play back so he can’t run by you and try to stop him from getting the lay up off. Except with dirk, if you waited back like that, trying to stop all 7 feet of him from getting in on the glass, he’ll just take the open shot, because he can. Wayyyy more dangerous. And again, this simply hasn’t been done before. That’s why he’s so great! No one played like him! People knew what he could do, they just couldn’t stop it, because he was that good at the game. And this is aside from him being a great person and stand up guy as well.",sports
It spreads the defense out and keep them on their toes more = more opportunities to catch defense off guard and get a wide open bucket.,sports
"The only guys who can guard 7 foot guys tend to be other 7 foot guys. They're long enough to contest the shots and they have the strength.

The 7 footer on defense can also defend against other players who drive to the basket, he uses his long arms to block shots of smaller players trying to score. That's called rim protecting. Basically, the big man on defense guards the big man on offense, and also protects the rim when smaller players drive to the hoop.

Normally a big man can only score under the basket, so the other big is usually guarding him under the basket and can also contest other players shots.

But Dirk being able to shoot made a big difference, because now the rim protecting big has to come out to guard his jump shot. They can't stay back on him, he basically pulls them out from the middle. That's called spacing. The big has to come out to defend Dirk, and now there's way more space for other players to get to the basket.",sports
"4 is the position of power forward. The five positions on the court are nicknamed 1-5 correlating to the size of the players normally at that position.

Traditionally 4s were pretty big guys who played close to the basket. A stretch 4 is a power forward who can shoot from outside the paint, so by moving away from the basket is ""stretching"" the floor.",sports
"4 is the power forward position in basketball. Traditionally you had 5 positions, point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center numbered 1-5 for ease in conversation basically (there could be some reason I don't know.) Normally the players get bigger with each position and play closer to the basket. Stretch 4 refers to a tall player who would normally be expected to play close to the net being able to play out around the 3 point line as a decent shooter and with a good amount of mobility. The NBA recently has gone through a shift where nearly every player needs to be capable of playing on the perimeter and shooting 3's or long 2's to be successful. But Dirk was one of the first to play that way and be successful.",sports
Ginobli is great.  2-3 year span was the second best 2 guard in the League.  Also an Argentinian and not a Euro.,sports

You're being downvoted but his shooting percentages are way lower than his career and he's not exactly an asset on defense. I love dirk but he's not exactly a huge asset to the team except in specific situations.,sports

"I thought there was no way this was possible. Sure, he has over 31,000 points, but 10% of a franchise total? Sure enough, looking at Basketball Reference, the Mavs average about 8000 points a year for 39 years, so that math lines up. Pretty crazy in that context.",sports
.......holy shit. That's a special kind of stat right there.,sports
When you have a highly accurate jump shot that has a high release and you're 7 feet tall and you slightly move away from the basket during the shot...yeah that's tough to defend. And by tough I mean impossible.,sports

Achieved despite his very constricted playing time over the last 4 seasons.  Yes Duncan has more rings. But I think it’s unfair to say he blows him out of the water.

"The only thing LeBron did that wasn't done before was make a tv special about it. Garnett (who was an absolute stud when he moved) joined Paul Pierce and they brought in Ray Allen who was still a good all around player. LeBron went to miami specifically to beat those guys. He just did it with more star power more in their prime. 

Except it is. Because the CEO of Boeing is free to move from Seattle to Texas to work for Lockheed Martin same way I'm free to move. He makes MORE than those NBA players and those companies are worth more than the entire league. If he's allowed to move LeBron can too. The amount of money doesn't change what the situation is. 

Thanks BTW",sports
"Well the mlb shows how no salary cap doesn't work. And the continued misery of the browns and other shitty squads (including the dolphins, who are in Miami) show that their model doesn't work. 

To be true contenders, teams have needed multiple Stars back to at least the 80s, where the showtime Lakers and Celtics won 7 titles (both teams had two guys on roster win league mvp) the bad boy Pistons had star power. Jordan never won one without pippen. Hakeem also wasn't flying solo. The Spurs and Lakers both rose to prominence after Jordan retired. LeBron took the reins from them but with sidekicks, and now the warriors. 

The bucks have the best record in the league. The Milwaukee bucks. I get that you want parity, but a) the NBA has more of it than the other leagues due to the lottery, b) teams have been assembling stars for titles for years, of all the teams I listed, none drafted all their stars that I can think of except maybe the 80s Celtics, and c) some teams just manage poorly. Look at any league in the world and show me top to bottom parity. You can't, it just doesn't exist. Not in college sports not in football not in soccer etc. 

The NBA actually does really well at parity, you just don't see it because of the current warriors (who got very lucky by a huge cap spike when Durant was a free agent, they shouldn't have had room for him).

The warriors were 1-1 in the finals without Durant. Almost lost to OKC before getting to those finals. 

Oh and that heat superteam went 2-2 in finals. More parity there than you're giving credit for. They were pushed to the absolute limit by a Boston squad in the playoffs too. One of the greatest of all time had to drop 45 in a game seven just to get them out of that series alive. 

So what would more parity look like? What league has achieved it and how do you think the NBA should get there?",sports

Lol you have no respect for a great of the game do you. Enjoy watching your 4-12 Oakland team while you lob even more ungrounded opinions across reddit since you clearly have nothing else to live for.,sports
"When your team is a dumpster fire, winning a game or two more at the expense of throwing the man who IS your franchise to the curb is asinine. If you’re saying he’s not great anymore, of course. But if you’re saying they should have cut him and filled his roster spot with a random backup, then go home. As for your Kevin Hart example, that is entirely different. Was Keven Hart ever a dominant player? Did he make your franchise relevant for ~20 years? Did he win you a Championship? No one is suggesting gimmick signings, only keeping a first ballot Hall of Famer around one more year.",sports

Please point out where I said the Mavs should cut dirk or get rid of him, no team should ever do that to a superstar. I said he should probably retire.",sports

Unless you live in Oakland, in which case... good luck in general.",sports

Also 10-6 vs 4-12 are two very different levels of failure.",sports
He is retiring though. You were just being captain obvious I guess?,sports
"Earthquakes happen in dumpy Texas too, wildfires are a part of life in our region, the drought is over and it’s expensive to live in beautiful places, cheap to live in ugly places like Texas. 

I live in the eastern Sierra, easily some of the most beautiful and amazing parts of this country.",sports
"You’re right I thought you were OP, buuuttt


10-6 but in dumpy Texas vs 4-12 in an actually amazing state equal out tho",sports
You should really reread the comment chain buddy. All the first comment says is that it's good he's retiring and I agreed. You are literally just agreeing with that statement and you made up this imaginary argument in your head that I was never actually making.,sports
"What happened to you in Texas? Who stole the magic from your life? Do you have an ex who hurt you there or something? You just seem to consistently bash Texas and never admit to anything wrong with California. 

“Wildfires are a part of life in our region” oh okay, guess if you accept it and it’s part of life, you can’t say it’s a negative right?

“The drought is over” well yeah... for another couple months, right? Then it’s back to widespread drought and fires.

Look, parts of Northern California are beautiful. Other parts, like a good portion of the overpopulated areas, they’re festering sores. Texas has gross parts of the state and beautiful parts of the state. Not see what your problem is with admitting your home has its flaws too.",sports
You said “this is what happens when people focus too much on nostalgia.” What happens? A legend and face of a franchise has a bad year and retries after it?,sports
"Dealt with rampant racism, religious nuts and terrible food. 

California has the deepest snowpack in the country and is 100% drought free, while Texas is actually in a drought in some areas. 

California has flaws, places like Fresno and Bakersfield that are incredibly reminiscent of Texas are absolutely terrible.",sports

[deleted],sports
that sucks... i also realized a mouth guard probably doesnt provide excellent protection against a puck. I think they are mainly designed to prevent concussions anyway,sports
Yeah :(,sports
1. Because it's pretty much the only way to get the clock to stop in a soccer game,sports
You forgot Winnipeg moving to Phoenix as well.,sports
">mouth guard probably doesnt provide excellent protection against a puck. 

Correct, puck to the face at speed means some teeth are going to come out, but teeth are stronger than you'd give them credit for.

>mainly designed to prevent concussions anyway

Wrong. Mouthguards are designed to protect against dental injury, and reduce the chance of biting off your tongue, or biting down on your teeth too hard in a collision.",sports
So they *don't* hate diving. They see it as a legitimate strategy.,sports

This is a pretty big deal. He's arguably Australia's most well known rugby union player and certainly one of their most talented. Last week he broke the Super Rugby try scoring record. This year is also a World Cup year so terminating his contract would be a huge blow to the Australian national side.,sports
"The ARU have confirmed they're going to sack him.

Good riddance, dickhead.",sports
I went to his Insta..... his entire feed is about jesus and god. It's very creepy.,sports
"Israel Fo-real son, watchu been upto dawg?",sports
"The unfortunate thing is that notwithstanding his rampant public homophobia, he could have been a terrific role model. He is supremely talented, humble and decent.

Very disappointed, especially because he had been warned before",sports
Just checked his Insta. Man's a Jesus freak.,sports
"Someone in this thread has already been down voted for disagreeing with the notion that his career should be threatened over his homophobic views. I support the rights of individuals to believe and say what they want without losing their jobs- even if what they are saying is widely considered hateful. I understand that this is an unpopular position, and I know that a lot of people strongly disagree with this view, but I have never had anyone help me understand why they think that an individual losing their job over their hatefulness improves society or makes homophobia any less prominent.",sports
Sad a man loses his career over thoughts and words and not actions....,sports
"Is it that big of a deal? Rugby union is not even the most popular sport with the word ""rugby"" in its name in Australia. It has been rapidly overtaken by soccer as Australia's 3rd favourite type of football. Australians don't really care about union that much anymore. Maybe in the late 90s/early 2000s when the Wallabies were actually winning things.

Just to note, I actually do like watching union... and the rod and screws in my leg can attest to the fact that I loved playing it, too. Do I prefer League? Yes. But I'll watch union too.",sports
Except for the occasional sponsor post. Like his Asics boots. Amazing they want their product in amongst all that.,sports
"I agree with your position in the sense that keeping him in the team and trying to help him understand his errors may actually have been a better way to deal with the issue but he's already done this once before and then signed a contract after that incident and part of that contract was that he wouldn't do it again. 

He had a professional contract. He broke part of the agreement and therefore he has been fired. In the same way any employee can be fired by the employer for breach of contract. 

The difference here is that in many countries and especially Australia, sports icons are our Gods and therefore what they do is even more intensely scrutinised by all of society.",sports
"Maybe I should have been more specific that this is a ""big deal"" in regards to rugby union.",sports
Can I get an ELI5 on union vs league?  Im interested in getting into rugby and last time I watched was the last world cup and it was a lot of fun.,sports
"In a World Cup year? Are you serious?

This is the most ridiculous statement by a mungo ever.

The man would have had the chance to star in one of the biggest sporting events this year, in a country who could potentially create a lasting legacy for the rest of his life.

Now he will have to be happy working Sundays at his local church in some backwater church in parramatta or penrith",sports
"Agreed there. The Wallabies are giving up one of their best players in a World Cup year. Considering that even with Folau they were at best a semi final or quarter final team, and losing Folau will set them back even further. This was absolutely the right move from the ARU, and not an easy one either.",sports
"Rugby union: 15 men on each team, unlimited contested rucks (that is, if you can maintain possession through the breakdown after your teammate gets tackled, you can keep the ball until you score), contested scrums, line-outs when the ball goes out of bounds. 5 points for a try, 2 points for a conversion, 3 points for a penalty goal, 3 points for a drop kicked field goal.

Rugby League: 13 men on each team, uncontested ruck, limited tackles (6, that is, after your team has been tackled 6 times you have to give up possession. Most teams kick it away on the 5th in most situations to avoid this), largely uncontested scrum (there are no rules preventing contesting the scrum, there's just rules making it harder to contest), no lineouts (ball goes out of bounds, it's a scrum). 4 points for a try, 2 for a conversion, 2 for a penalty goal, 1 point for a drop kicked field goal.

There are other differences, but this covers most of them.

In general, I'd say union is more tactical and league is more exciting. I love both sports for different reasons.

As for why the two sports split: Rugby Union even until the 1990s was a strictly amateur game. Rugby League was invented in the late 19th century, and professionalism was an option. This (in most parts of the world, with a few exceptions) has led League to be seen as the more ""working class"" game and Union as the more ""upper class"".",sports
They were even worse leading into the last World Cup and made the final,sports
"Wow, thank you for the excellent reply.  From the little bit I've experienced it seems really exciting. I hope it gains popularity in America in the near future.",sports
"The US is likely to see a surge in Union popularity with the MLR (Major League Rugby) taking off and seemingly doing well. Plus, Union is already pretty popular being that it and Sevens are the most commonly played over here. For instance, you can find a Union team at basically every college campus across the country... and a Sevens team made out of players from said team.

Between Union and Sevens, and League being an almost bastardization of the two, I doubt League catches on over here... at least not any time soon.

Plus, and this is just my personal opinion, Union > Sevens > League.",sports

That’s dope.,sports
Wonder what kind of contract he’s gonna get,sports
Now just build one 8foot tall,sports
But did they have to make the robot black 🙄,sports
"iCurry, starting at 999$.",sports
Just imagine what their A-league robot can do!,sports
Looking like Markelle Fultz with the release,sports
But who made the call to have it wear a studded black gimp suit,sports
Right between the eye!,sports
Don't worry guys... we have the Globetrotters.,sports
Why is he black?,sports
They made him black....,sports
"It's all on the jersey ""TOYOTA"" lol",sports
Did anyone else see how excited it was after making the shot?,sports
Jurbs lol cool,sports
Ssick.,sports
A robot made a three before Ben Simmons oh hell nah,sports
It's good to see Grey Fox was able to move past his violent nature and find a sport he excels in.,sports
even the other robot starts to clap...,sports
*Activate 3 point protocol,sports
He's absolutely stunned after sinking that shot!,sports
Now just build one 8foot tall and stand it under the rim.,sports
Japanese Bubbles behind the robot in the beginning.  Same glasses and face.,sports
Someone add the deal with it sunglasses and music to the end.,sports
"Since the Lakers didn't get AD, can we trade the whole young core for this robot? Paging Magic....",sports
This isn't surprising at all. Dribble and spin then shoot from a point determined by the machine and shoot. No static code. This would WOW and horrify lol!,sports
The way it drops it's hands at the end like it knew what it did was impressive but was trying to play it off like it was no big deal 😂,sports
I mean it makes sense that it's black,sports
The guy kneeling behind it looks like the Asian Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys,sports
Is that bubbles?,sports
I guess the robot has to look the part as well.,sports
There's another robot on the side cheering it on. They're taking over.,sports
I fucking love Toyota.,sports
"While this is impressive, it's kinda math at that point",sports
That's..... impressive,sports
The most pondering part is the cheering for an object that can’t appreciate that.,sports
Game!...Wires!,sports
"NBA players gotta be sweating their impending replacement by robots, they should all look into call center jobs, those will be safe for forever right?",sports
But can he dunk?,sports
"Maybe in the future Skynet scenario, Japan's robots will be sided with the humans, vs the American robots who rebel because they kept getting knocked down.",sports
Can’t even swish it? Steph would have swished it,sports
That stare down would get you a technical in the NBA,sports
It’s over for Stephen Curry.,sports
I was too distracted by the guy behind the robot who looks like the Japanese version of bubbles from trailer park boys,sports
NOTHING BUT NET. SUCK IT HUMANS. BEGIN INSULT LOOP. HA HA. HA HA. INSULT OVER.,sports
Coming to an NBA halftime show near you.,sports
The end is near boys...,sports
Kobe Beef,sports

KOBE!!!,sports
He so smug at the end...,sports
He's already got a scholarship offer from Duke.,sports
the robot has to be black,sports
It's all about knee bend.,sports
It has begun,sports
"Eh, his mechanics need some work.",sports
Meanwhile in Japan,sports
Automation is coming for ALL the jobs.,sports
"Can anyone who knows about robotics explain what the difficult part of this is?

Sensors to find distance to basket

Computer to figure out math on release point and force on ball needed

Fancy overbuilt catapult to shoot the ball in a way instructed by the computer. (For greater distance and weights a trebuchet is recommended)

To be fair I am impressed, and have absolutely none of the skills required to build anything like this.",sports
The Gimp woke up in the basement of the pawn shop and came to a realization...,sports
I want sound.,sports
His friend cheered for him so cute.,sports
Don't forget to carry your floating point decimals!,sports
That look at the end is cold,sports
"He even kept the hand raised, baller move",sports
Anyone notice the Asian bubbles at the beginning of the video ?? Lol,sports
The Japanese are going to ruin the planet with their AI research. We need to stop with the AI crap before it’s too late.,sports
Is that a Japanese bubbles controlling the robot?,sports
"With the first pick of the draft, the NY Knicks select... whatever the fuck this is.",sports
Follow through is on point,sports
Stroking the 3 like Robert Parrish out there,sports
Nice follow through!,sports

Early Pathfinder prototype throwing grenades colourized,sports
N07H1NG 8U7 N37,sports
They are celebrating our doom!,sports
Better than ben simmonds,sports
"I’m not a basketball fan, so I don’t know much about the terminology.   Can someone tell me when and how the term “drains the shot” began?

Because up until a month or so, I don’t think I ever heard this phrase before.   Now, all of the sudden, I see it every time basketball is discussed.

Anyone?",sports
This confirms that Steph is a robot,sports
This is so nutty omg,sports
Black Steph Curry!,sports
Anyone notice the white robot follows the ball and claps his hands..,sports
Is it just me or does the guy behind the robot look like an asian version of bubbles?,sports
that follow-through tho. so smooth.,sports
"In Japanese -
“What colour should we make our robot basketball player?”
“...”",sports
"I love the reaction shot from the robot at the end. ""This, is what I exist for.""",sports
Weirdest part is that there is another robot watching his buddy and cheering him on.,sports
That's going to be a pretty cheap salary for a 6 million dollar man.,sports
Nerves of steel.,sports
"Ok. Stop the planet, I'm ready to get off now.",sports
Looks so lifelike,sports
Frakin toasters...,sports
"AirBot. 

There’s nothing in the rules that says a robot can’t play basketball",sports
even the robot basketball player is black,sports
More impressive than a black hole.,sports
The black steph curry,sports
it’s gonna get the shit swatted outta him every time taking that long to shoot smh,sports
"...we’re to late boys, its over",sports
That robot held its hand up after the shot like a boss. Did they use D Wade as model?,sports
"Watch out human basketball players, move over for the more fun and sexy robot basketball players (in a couple decades I'd assume).

Its gonna be glorious watching robots play sports.",sports
# He looks so happy,sports
Deus ex machina,sports
Is this how Nintendo is announcing Super Mario hoops 3v3 for the switch?,sports
I thought that was shaq for a sec...but then he made the freethrow,sports
I’m currently reading the Hyperion cantos. That robot is totally Shrike.,sports
How long did they spend making this Robot that can drain a half court shot ?,sports
It's like that 2014 Nike commercial,sports
This robot gets more cheers from mum than me.,sports
Calculated.,sports
Even the robot basketball players are black.,sports
The look on its face is priceless. Pure joy from his hard work,sports
But can he get the trajectory right over and over and over again....,sports
At least the robot is black lol,sports
"“What is my purpose?”

#TO SINK THREEFERS ON THE BUZZER BAYBEEEEE",sports
Cool but let’s see if he can do that with a hand in his face.,sports
MVP MVP MVP!!!,sports
This has incredible meme potential,sports
Why does he have to be black?,sports
That cool and everything but can he make a shot for charity?,sports
Its a giant black pineapple,sports
Everybody missing the VR controlled Robot on the side,sports
Can I get some hot sauce?,sports
I for one welcome our new robot basketball league,sports
Future  NBA i guess.,sports
[Look at the confidence](https://imgur.com/m2R8KPh),sports
The zoom in lmao that was pretty funny,sports
The expression on it's face after the shot is priceless,sports
That Ballin downward hand,sports
We are creating our demise. Full effect.,sports
"What's even greater is the other robot on the sideline cheering as he made it. They're not just replacing the players, they're replacing US as well.",sports
Game. Bots.,sports
BT-7274: Trust me,sports
I smell a new sport brewing. I'm thinking a battle bots/ basketball mashup.,sports
Kobe!,sports
Why's the robot gotta be black?,sports
Just enslave me already.,sports
Stephtron Curry,sports
Somebody make this thing go against Shaq!   For charity.,sports
The guy kneeling down next to the robot is the Asian reincarnation of Bubbles from TTPB.,sports
THE JOY THAT THIS TOTALLY HUMAN ATHLETE DISPLAYS PLEASES ME. GO [LOCAL SPORTS TEAM]!!!,sports
I was expecting Lebron to come in at the end.,sports
Why’d he have to be black?,sports
That thing’s shot so slow. Shaqs free throws are faster.,sports
Love the other robot on the sidelines that tracks the shot and then celebrates when it goes in,sports
"Ok guys, I figured out a way for Dirk to not have to retire, all we need is a heist to swipe this robot and someone who knows how to make people into cyborgs.",sports
Japanese bubbles there at the beginning. You know this thing is built out of shopping carts,sports

Damn the way people got all happy with the robot makes me think that we can start following robots like they're gods in the future,sports
Rare footage of me shooting my shot and it actually works out.,sports
Kobé Bryant,sports
Look at that pose after he drains it!,sports
The best part is the spectating robot chearing,sports
Guess the Rockets found its new shooter. 😁,sports
2048 RBA CHAMPIONSHIP,sports
Not cool not gonna like,sports
This is should be a word problem in high school physics lmao,sports
It's got ice in its veins ... Or circuits,sports
Noooooo disassemble!,sports
Slap some green hair and glasses on that bad boy and you might as well have Midorima.,sports
What would happen if you move him from center Court? Can it still make the shot? Useless crap.,sports
Chick couldn't even clap with her hands. Needs a plastic hand to clap with... wtf,sports
All Hail our pineapple overlords!,sports
Just absolutely shoving it in your face by leaving the release hand up. Damn.,sports
That pose,sports
goose neck!,sports
Reminds me of Air Bud,sports
You can tell the placer of the basketball never played by the way he places the seams.,sports
The robot is all LeBron need right now. -Stephen A. Smith 😂,sports
It’s black,sports
"I, for one, welcome the new robot sports leagues",sports
Is it doing calculations or is it put specifically at that distance so it will make it?,sports
Kawahi Leonard on suicide watch,sports
The look of indifference on the robots “face” after it sinks the shot: priceless,sports
You can see the excitement on its face,sports
Why’s he gotta be black tho,sports
"If the robot held up the 3 fingers after, that would've got me.",sports
And so it begins,sports
"Just as Dirk is retiring...

Coincidence? I think not.",sports
Now we need robot wrestling.,sports
BT: Trust me,sports
Nothing but skynet.,sports
Black pineapple poker face,sports
It's Klay in a robot suit.,sports
The other robot following the ball... we are going to be enslaved.,sports
“KOBE!!!”,sports
# KOBE,sports
Hundreds of years from now some sports might just be a competition of who's robots are the best,sports
Why is it black?,sports
Better than turning them into weapons. 😍😍😍,sports
"This gif may be the only thing that saves us from total annihilation when the robots take over. If they see that we cheered for their earliest ancestors, they may keep us as pets.",sports
Somebody make this into a deal with it gif with the sunglasses,sports
"Game, blouses.",sports
"Cool, now give this sucker some grenades and send it to the middle east.",sports
[First thing that came up in my mind](https://youtu.be/oQF8rQaIjUE?t=47),sports
Kobe!,sports
"Anyone else think his shot looks like Shawn Marion? We all made fun of his shot, but was he just from the future?",sports
Is this the future.. this is boring af...,sports
Are we not gonn talk about the fact that this roboter is black?,sports
“Lmao ez af”,sports
Nuts to me that when it pans over afterwards everyone in the crowd isn’t going nuts. Love how the woman looks so excited though!,sports
“And yet I still feel nothing...”,sports
Toyota missed an opportunity to make the number on his jersey 86,sports

I like that the robot is black,sports
"Damnit people, can't we all just agree this is how you get SkyNet",sports
now take all that hard work and know how and make an appealing next generation supra like nissian did with the gtr ;),sports
The real life 2K cheat code to beat Steph Curry,sports
"So much swag, he held the wrist.",sports
R/accidental racism,sports
Doesnt count if he didnt say “Kobe” before the shot,sports
Why’s it have to be a Japanese robot? Racist...,sports
So can we merge this with Dirk and unretire him,sports
Someday a robot will sign a lifetime contract for $0 dollars. Ticket prices will still go up.,sports
I love to zoom in on the face after the shot,sports
In 10-20 years we’ll have entire robotic leagues.. man what a time to be alive,sports
Why's the robot black though?,sports
"I don't have time to watch this to the end. It is fascinating how many times he hits it in the row, but I'm sure he'll miss if you watch long enough.",sports
"Robot basketball, I’m down. Football too while we’re at it, nothing better than seeing robots destroyed after each play.",sports
From downtown! BOOM shockalocka!,sports
Thats cheating he's using aimbot,sports
Am I the only one who noticed the funny looking Asian guy below the robot in the first 10 seconds,sports
"Is ""drains shot from the logo"" basketballeeze for something specific?",sports
He’s so modest after too! Classy robot👍🏻,sports
Just got busted for PEO....Performance Enhancing Oil,sports
Nothing but net!,sports
That football add with robots vs players seems closer than ever,sports
And we are one step closer to the cylons or terminator.,sports
"Announcing: Rockets sign him to next season, park him in the corner.",sports
Of course it’s black,sports
I wish America took this shit as seriously.,sports
Did the lady at the end have a clapping device? What is the purpose of such an item?,sports
"A robot should be able to do this infinitely many times in a row, shouldn't it",sports
wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist,sports
"Laugh, but they'll take our women next.",sports
That's Kawhi,sports
Literally teaching black robots how to shoot.... nothing could go wrong.,sports
The end is finally here!,sports
So..... nobody is saying anything about how that white robot reacted?,sports
"What we saw that day was but the flutter of a glimpse...insignificant seeming at first but a glimpse it was...at the future of basketball.

The Global Robot Basketball League. Or GRBL (pronounced Gurble).

Very tall people were left with no sport to call their own and had to get jobs. It was very sad.",sports
"Seriously, no one saw the other robot that watched the ball then started to clap when it went in?",sports
Clap for robot.,sports
Fucking creepy,sports
Can it make the shot from anywhere or just the logo?,sports
u/VredditDownloader,sports
Tech Curry,sports
Coolant in his veins 😤😤,sports
It didn't even have to bounce the ball a couple of times to check that it still works.,sports
So Toyota creates Steph Curry?,sports
"Honestly, nobody gives a fuck. Obviously a robot can sink a shot, WOOHOO!",sports
I bet he’s trash in the paint though,sports
Well he is black.,sports
Robots really be coming after EVERYBODY’s job.,sports
I read this as Lego robot. Still impressed regardless.,sports
Gotta make the robot black?!? Some racist shit right there!,sports
Of course they made it black,sports
Spoiler alert.,sports
"They take our jobs and now this, what next??",sports
What if Steph Curry and a Scion had a baby,sports
He may have the coldest stare down in the league,sports
This is the beginning of the end... in 2055 the NBA will be overrun with these BDSM robots.,sports
"Yeah, well I made a rubber band powered catapult out of wood that shot a ping ball 15 meters with precision accuracy 1 out of 3 shots before it self destruct.",sports
*robot voice* Kobe,sports
Did they call him Midorima?  They should....,sports
Its funny to imagine how bad the programmers shot probably is,sports
WhY dOeS iT hAvE tO bE bLaCk,sports
"Sorry, but that’s a quite basic calculation. That bot even stands on a solid plate. There are much more advanced things out there. Anyway - keep innovating Toyota, I like your products!",sports
"With a few tweaks and an Orioles uniform, the birds just found a replacement for Chris Davis",sports
"The other white robot that watched it, looked.to be starting a cheer or clap. Must be one proud robo-coach.",sports
"this is how it begins, in 100 years we will look at this as the precursor to robots taking over the NBA",sports
The question is why he black,sports
"That’s because ziplines  are fun, friend!",sports
Took it forever to get ready to shoot...and people say robots are gonna take over? Steph Curry can pull up and just shoot it and it'll go in 😤,sports
"Stay in school, kids. No need to dream about the NBA now unless you are in the robot overlord class. If you're lucky you'll get to polish robot balls.",sports
My body is ready for full on robo combat basketball.,sports
Why is it black,sports
"If this robot had veins, there would be ice in 'em.",sports
"I know everyone freaks out about robots 
“ they toook our jeeerbs “
But I’m pretty excited to see all them advance and see where the future goes with it .",sports
*Skynet Online*,sports
Now see if it can do it when a charity is involved.,sports
Already better than Japanese professionals.,sports
Can't wait for a robo-league to be implemented in the NBA! Gonna need to improve on our slow-motion camera's so we can actually process their plays lool,sports
Its because he is black,sports
better than Shaq,sports
This is impressive but theoretically couldn't robots do this a long time ago? What makes this one particularly special?,sports
Not legit didn’t yell and one,sports
Yea but can he do it twice?,sports
I like to imagine it yelled Kobe right before launching that bad boi.,sports
Still hit the rim.,sports
I embrace my robot overlords :),sports
"This just in: 

Orioles in discussion with Toyota to build a Chris Davis robot.",sports
Still faster than Joe Ingles.,sports
We’re doomed...,sports
Just what we need,sports
"I imagine it saying something along the lines of ""The age of Flesh is over"" after doing that",sports
What’s it gonna be like when robots start getting drafted into human teams,sports
His head looks like a black pineapple 🍍,sports
The black mamba vs the black roomba,sports
Did the other robot clap?!,sports
"I’m not trying to be judgement or rude, especially because they can probably do laps around me academically, but the guy kneeling by the robot... looks exactly like the kind of guy to be kneeling by a robot.",sports
"Gort, klaatu basketball niktu!",sports
Wouldn't this robot be able to sink it every time?,sports
This robot looks like it's into some kinky shit.,sports
He shoots like Marcus Camby.,sports
"From the logo, I thought is called center.",sports
Is this Space Jam 2?,sports
They should’ve programmed it to hold up the 3 after it made the shot,sports
I think I remember this 90s movie.,sports
robots mom clapping in the front row,sports
I for one welcome our new robot overlords,sports
Bruh I’ll beat that fool one on one yeah aight,sports
Funny how they made it black,sports

So Pretty!",sports
And he is black,sports
so this is how the human race dies... with thunderous applause.,sports
"Any catapult system can be set to make a shot like that from a static location after lots of adjustments. The main question is: can the robot automatically calculate distance, trajectory, force etc and make the shot if you move it to a new position?",sports
Game. Blouses,sports
Next you're gonna tell me Pitch-a-tron 5000 was just a modified howitzer.,sports
Anyone else watch it over and over thinking they were different shots? I took about three times before I realized it was on loop☹️,sports
Yea that wasn't weird at all,sports
Smug metal bitch.,sports
[First that robot that finds Waldo](https://twitter.com/ckpyt/status/1095405263358709760) and now this? Time to enjoy the last few months before the robot overlords take over.,sports
swish swish bish,sports
Did nobody else see the other robot watching and throwing it's hands up in celebration after the shot??,sports
Who else saw his brother robot raise his arms in celebration,sports
Can’t beat em build a robot. Most important rule in the book,sports
u/vredditdownloader,sports
Fuck yes I'll absolutely watch basketball if had robots.,sports
Did you see that smug MF leave his hand hanging?,sports
Been watching for 2 hours and he still hasn't missed !,sports
It’s starting,sports
All it does is shoot 3's?? Paging Daryl Morey!,sports
It's a leftie too,sports
Wtf? Even the other robot tracked the ball and put his hands up in celebration.,sports
Why is it black?,sports
I like how they made him black.,sports
Japan really built an entire robot that made a three-pointer before Ben Simmons.,sports
"Ok so how long do we have until BattleBots meets basketball?

I'd love to see a broken backboard every game. The focus would be on the guys controlling the robots as far as wins and losses go but It could be tremendously entertaining",sports
Already has more 3s than Ben Simmons,sports
They made him black ....,sports
But why make it so evil looking? Why?!,sports
Experience Tranquility!,sports
Lebot James,sports
"He’s so good,” repeating it four times.
Zion then said he wanted to add the Toyota robot to the list of players he works out with this summer.",sports
Boston dynamics is far mroe impressiv.e,sports
"Was this programmed to be able to make the shot only from this exact distance? Or did it calculate ‘what’ to do, via its own sensors?",sports
This is it people. Our hubris will be our undoing.,sports
Steph Curry underneath his human skin disguise,sports
The spectating robot that begins to clap is what got me,sports
Imagine how insane robot basketball would be,sports
"And all that's robot was thinking after draining that shot was ""KOBE!""",sports
Kobe,sports
Wasn't a clean one tho... We still have hope,sports
Their autonomous driving isn't that much existing...,sports
"Love how it holds its hand in the air, I know it has no facial expressions, but to me it has such a smug look on its face when the camera zooms in.",sports
alright.. where's Will Smith at?,sports
Just wait until the robot basketball league.,sports
Let's see him with some wind,sports
That's just a guy wrapped in tape.. what's impressive?,sports
"Is it AI based? Can they place it anywhere in the court randomly, and the robot would calculate to get the shot right?",sports
And leaves it hanging.. I like this robot 😂,sports
"WOW. out of the 180 times i've seen the robot throw, it didn't miss any.... amazing.",sports
I would enjoy watching a bunch of robots playing basketball,sports
The robots are about to take over the whole entire basketball game,sports
One step closer to Mutant League Basketball.,sports
I can see the robots smug face even if it doesnt have a face,sports
Domo Arigato Mister Roboto!,sports
His mother in the stands looks so proud of him.,sports
"Why is everyone clapping and cheering instead of holding their head in their hands and running around horrified, scared, screaming for their lives?",sports

The future of basketball is here ladies and gentlemen,sports
Knicks need this robot,sports
"Ohhhh, deep THREAT. Was confused for a moment.",sports
"Dam, check out those fundamentals",sports
with that al horford shot form,sports
Clap for the robot who will never hear you!,sports
Weird flex broBOT,sports
"I'm interested to know whether it aimed the shot itself or if it was previously determined with a bit of trial and error.

If it aimed the shot itself then it's a game-changer but if it was merely known that placing the robot at this angle and distance would result in a basket, then it's less impressive because we've had robots with this level of precision for years now.",sports
My favorite part is how the camera man at the bottom of the screen panned back over to the shooter in hopes of getting the robot's reaction.,sports
"""This is my life now"" ~ Robot... probably",sports
My form looks exactly like that and I can’t even drain a free throw da fuck,sports
The T1000 is on fire!,sports

He flexin.,sports
I feel like that shot of him after he drains it could become a new reaction gif,sports
"Bet he plays better defense than James Harden, too.",sports
"Is the robot doing the physics calculations, or are humans?",sports
"3 point yeah i score it hope that you record it, drain gang",sports
"Meanwhile at Mitsubishi HQ:

Guys get to work building a robot to block the shot",sports
Better form than Lonzo.,sports

neat,sports
"Jesus, he really hits one after another without missing a single shot",sports
Why am I clapping?,sports
"Hey look, it’s Pathfinder!",sports
So does it analyze the shot it needs to take or is pre programmed and has to be in the exact perfect position?,sports
I want to see what the robots at a Japanese A-league team are capable of.,sports
NBA 55k,sports
"""and then i learned to throw people. much harder, but i am much smarter...""",sports
"Fuck, he made 16 in a row, and just doesn’t stop.",sports
And he only tried 46 times before this shot!,sports
"I would totally watch robot basketball with each robot made by one of the two teams of competing scientists although it could be completely ruined if they all shoot so perfectly unless they could also jump high or be very proficient at defending, taking away the ball. Either way, funny concept to imagine.",sports
Wow. He doesn't miss. Just keeps making them over and over again. How many does he make in a row?,sports
"Cheer now, die later.",sports
Reminds me of Kevin McHale.,sports
It's funny how the made the robot black,sports

"No this is pretty impressive.  The basket is far enough away that this is a super precise shot.  The robot was holding the basketball in essentially a hand, so it needed to take into account exactly how the ball was resting in its hand, and the shot was a complicated maneuver that closely resembled a real shot.

Building a catapult to shoot the basketball into the hoop would be pretty easy, but this is pretty hard.",sports
"No it’s not preset. It’s actually using AI and learning the shooting. This is the last shot he showed that night. He shot free throw, back board shoot(failed), etc. But AI is not inside the body, it is located beside inside some box.",sports
"That wouldn't be too difficult. When I was in high school, I was on a robotics team which competed in events like the one in the gif. Ours looked more like a box on wheels.

More often than not, these are just demonstrations of the robot or simple publicity for toyota.

"It could still have some sort of sensory and feedback to allow it to shoot accurately from anywhere but if it isn't learning and improving on it's own then it's not really AI. I've been listening to a lot of podcasts with researchers in AI and they all seem to agree that the learning component is what distinguishes autonomous robots from true intelligent devices. Its like if you ever seen those videos from the robots from Boston dynamics, they are amazing but they aren't intelligent, just good robots. I'm not trying to downplay the impressiveness of these robots, I just thought I'd share some of the things I've gathered from listening to these researchers.

"That's still just calculating some positions and doing a little physics. AI would be more like letting it  take lots of shots and learn what works on it's own, but with a task this ""simple"" I don't think you even need AI, just basic math and very precise, fancy mechanical bits.",sports
"I think you are right that this is a demo of mechanical movement and there's no need to overcomplicate that, but

I don't think the 'vision' aspect is very difficult to get right for a narrow use case like this.  I guess it really depends on how you define vision, a problem with many words we use when AI/Robotics gets talked about.  You only need two real pieces for this demo - the ability to identify the basket and the ability to find the range to the basket.  The former is easily accomplished with the bright orange of the basket, and the latter is just pointing a laser range finder at said identified point.

I'm not trying to be down on you or anything, it's just a topic I think is super neat.  Another point I thought of (and this is, again, devil's advocate - I think the actual demonstration in this thread is very simple, because why would you make it complicated) is that you could probably take the robot to a few spots on the court where it captured *still* images that it then mapped (or just directly program a mapped model in).  At that point, assuming it accurately knows it's start position, it doesn't even really need any external sensors to do this. The precision of movement robots can achieve is amazing, and allows for all kinds of crazy aproaches to problems.",sports

"2011-2016 were legitimately difficult series to predict. The heat should have beat the Mavericks but LeBron played so poorly in that series that people to this day still see him as someone who doesn’t show up in big games. After that debacle, nobody could have expected LeBron to do what he did to KD. The first spurs-hear finals was legit incredible and either team could have won. The second was the coming out party for Leonard and that spurs team played even better in the finals than they did the rest of the year. I remember being one of the people who predicted San Antonio to win this one though so if you want to say that Smith should have seen it coming then I’ll give you this one. Nobody really expected the warriors to win that first one until they did. That Cavs team was supposed to be a super team. But if I remember correctly, Kyrie got hurt in that series and Kevin Love couldn’t match up with Draymond at all. And they didn’t have an answer for steph and clay. The second year was the one where the warriors were up 3-1 and then lost three straight games. Like, say what you will, but being too critical over anyone for missing all of those is kinda crazy considering how the series actually played out and what the expectations were going into them. If you were around for any of them, you would have seen how torn the entire communities were for each of these.",sports

Also, learn English, you simpleton. You are barely able to put together words in a grammatically correct sentence.",sports
I feel like I just woke up from the eight year long nightmare promulgated by the shit stain on the American presidency that is Obama.,sports
"You're free to not like Obama, disagree with his policies, personally idc... but ""nightmare?"" As a foreigner I gotta ask, was it really *that* bad?",sports
"Sure, you can ask. He campaigned on ending espionage on Americans by the government, and he not only didn't end it, he expanded it, renewed it, and used it to spy on at least one political opponent. He campaigned as a constitutional scholar, yet he trampled all over the constitution, both by enacting Obamacare using unconstitutional executive orders and by punishing whistle-blowers at the highest rate of any president before or since. If this isn't enough, he got caught lying about the Libya scandal (when he found out about it) and about whether he had emailed Hillary Clinton to her private email address in order to cover up her crimes. Going back to Obamacare, the idea that the government can force you to purchase a product from private companies or face a penalty in the form of a tax is the most anti-capitalistic thing one could think of. It's completely against the founding principles of this country. The man stood for everything that was the opposite of America: he lied and cheated and deceived people in order to get elected and then acted against the country in many, many ways. Please let me know if you have a problem with my assessment. In addition to all this, there are copious activities which make him an obvious self-interested anti-American. One that stands out the most is that he canceled plans for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste permanent disposal facility. It was going to be the first solution we would have for permanent disposal of nuclear waste, and he canceled it as a political move against the legacy of GWB who drove the project just up to the finish line. It was almost complete and he reversed it. The man was a disaster for this country, and a brown stain on its presidency.",sports
And then his teammate hits him on the head with his bat or stick. I'm trying to learn how this game is played but it is a bit difficult.,sports

"Exactly the questions the commentators are asking all the time. But, this particular bowler is known to lose the plot in such situations.",sports

You risk bowling a wide and bringing it down to 2 to win off 1 ball, or worse having the wide go for two or even four byes and that's game over.

If the batsman gets even the slightest edge on the bouncer, it's going for 6 and game over.

Obviously a yorker is a very good delivery when needing four or more from the last ball, but the margin for error is reasonably small too.",sports

That golf ball stays suspiciously still when the tee is hit out from under it. Where is captain disillusion when you need him?,sports
"Its fake. If you watch the background, you can see that it was edited whe it loops. The lighting changes, but only just around the ball. Also, its not all happening fast enough for that to actually happen. The elastic speed of the tee os not fast enough to act before gravety on the ball. (It should act instantly, and the ball does not move visibly at all). The tee has a rim. That means that if it moves, the rim should push the ball with it. It does not. And finally, if you look closely at the wobbling tee, it does noy stand up to scrutiny. Before it settles back, it gets thrown left, and goes back to the tee, but looses all its momentum way to fast to stop back in its origional position. It should have been thrown right to bleed off inertia, swung back left and vibrated a bit (like when you strum a guitar string, or like what happens with literally any elastic material). Instead it just magically snapped back into place. Everyone should be just a bit more sceptical when presented with unbelievable footage.",sports

Agreed. Always end up hovering my club next to the ball just to get a solid hit,sports
Hes hitting a fairway wood off that tee. You should hit those off the ground or tee'd up about a half inch. This tee is set for a driver.,sports
Bite it off to the correct size.,sports
Just stand on a phonebook. Next problem.,sports
The ones I've used you can push in or pull up,sports
"Well they’re made for drivers, not 3 woods like in the gif",sports

Friggin things chew up your clubs too. I try to avoid them,sports
Is that why I suck when I go to top golf? Lol,sports
There are multiple sizes to pick from. The pro shop will often have a couple of varying heights and if they don’t I’m sure you can buy one for like 2-3 bucks online and just bring your own. Lift up the mat and swap it out.,sports

They’re that high becasue it’s meant for drivers not irons,sports

A proper range should have numerous tees of different heights to chose from. Just lift up the mat and replace it to a size of your liking.,sports
"If you're using one of today's insanely huge drivers where the head is the size of a watermelon you should be good, otherwise it's way too high",sports

Happens more often than you’d think with those sort of rubber tees.,sports
"It doesn't defy gravity, it has almost no time to move anywhere before the tee gets placed back under it",sports
"You realize an upward force was applied by the club head swinging under it, right? I'm guessing it's from stretching of the rubber material as the club makes contact, or the top half of the tee being compressed which then would release that energy up into the ball.

inertia,sports
Does it though?,sports
"""ball does not move visibly at all""
Watch it again, fullscreen this time. The tee bounces the ball up slightly, also giving it a bit of rotation. As to the vibration, the tees are stiffer than you think. They don't wobble back and forth that much. Once it resumes the shape of a tube, a pretty rigid structure, it takes a greater amount of force than it's own inertia to break that tube shape again, hence why it stops so quickly. If it was as floppy as you are expecting, it wouldn't hold the ball up.",sports
You can watch the ball spin,sports

"You would like these rubber tees then! What I usually do to warm up is just swing and graze the top of the tee, with no ball on it. Just swing for a while doing the same motion. 

Then once you've done it for a while, working up to your normal swing strength, have a friend place the ball on the tee.

Specifically a friend, so that whatever physical stance, motion, whatever you have perfected doesn't need to change.

I'm a big fan of beginners starting at the driving range. You get more hits in, swing without fear of grass damage, no consequences for losing your ball. Just a lot more effective.",sports
Worth it to not use these tees,sports
"Surprise, motherfucker!",sports

"Don’t fret about the perceived miss.  It’s really about taking the shot.  You learn from your mistake, make adjustments, and get back out there.  This applies to golf just as much to life.  You may not land the job, girl, or something else that catches your fancy.  Don’t give up, we take these experiences and use them in the future to make us successful.  I’ve never learned anything by doing it right the first time, the way I get back up is by looking at what I’ve learned and making adjustments so my next attempt could be the one...if it’s not, well I have more data to review for my next attempt!

Be honest with yourself, be proud of the attempt, and use that to motivate you to get back in the game!",sports

"""golf game"" talking about his buddy's skill at golf, not that he was playing a golf game...",sports
If you look closely right under the ball on one of the last wobbles it looks to me like you can see the tee double. Just the part that touches the ball. To me it looks like an artifact of an animated mask,sports
"To me, that looks like a poor photoshop attempt.  Doesn't change my view, but YMMV",sports
Hehe,sports
"When I watch it, I do not see ANY movement from the ball. It looks like it just floats there",sports

"Bullshit, a wood tee would break or go flying not snap back into position like this rubber driving range tee.",sports
"This can't happen if you're teeing it up at the *proper* height. At most, only half the ball should be above the top of the club at rest.",sports
Yeah... uh.... no.  Explain how this happens with a wood tee.,sports
r/thathappened ? Lol,sports
By accident*,sports
A wood tee can't bounce back up like this you fucking liar. Why make shit up like this?,sports
That's an airshot dude.,sports
"That means your tee wasn’t proper height. It was too high.

Yes, wood tees can be too high",sports
Imagine lying without thinking if your lie is even  possible.,sports
"I promise you that if the guy is that bad, he's probably also not good enough to generate a whole lot of power in his swing. Certainly not enough to break the club lol",sports
Is that a 3 wood though? I thought it was a utility driver. Either way you are correct.,sports
I mean not necessarily.  You are generalizing as much as the guy you are countering.  Everyone is different.  Like a lot of people tee up the ball on par 3 holes even though they are teeing off with an iron.  I always hit it straight off the deck.  Teeing off with a fairway wood i may or may not tee it up depending on how nice the tee box is.,sports
"I tee my 3 wood up about a quarter of an inch. For the lay person watching they wouldn't think I was ""teeing it up"" at all. Your point stands, but it's still a club that is made to hit off of the ground in the fairways.",sports
"Yeah I'll either use the top half of a standard tee, or just kick up a little turf to make a tiny mound.

&#x200B;

A tee that high would be nearly impossible to hit a fairway wood off of.",sports
Just not as high as you tee up the driver.,sports
And it’s so cliche in golf but truly keeping your eye on the ball too. Like exaggerate it obnoxiously even. When I notice my shot getting away from me 8/10 times it’s because I’m getting lazy on that.,sports
"Shoulders should turn, not tilt.",sports
"I do this. I rarely hit where I aim with my irons. So I aim right at the fucking bunker. I never hit it in them. Unless it's a course I haven't played and don't see the bunker. 

I once told my friend I was going to knock his ball of off the green with my ball on a par 3 from the tee box. I fucking called it and hit his ball. I was so mad because if I would have aimed for the hole on that swing, I could have got a hole in one. And I've never got a hole in one before.",sports

"No need for the passive aggressive ..., sry didnt pick that up English ain't my primary language.",sports
"Although after looking again, I could be wrong and it could just be video compression.",sports
"This happens sometimes, but only with this exact type of rubber tee. It springs back into place super fast before the ball falls. We used to see who could do this first on the driving range.",sports
Watch it in full screen. That's the only way I could tell the ball moved.,sports
Oo my dear lord you're right. I was only able to watch it in half screen and I got it to full and it does move! Wow,sports
I concur. We need an explanation of how this happened 3 times with a regular tee.,sports

"Hmm, yep. Yep. I know some of these words !",sports
"""I’m Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that’s clear is that choking up is the one true solution!""",sports
I do the same with my irons sometimes on par 3’s.  Especially if the green is in between clubs as it seems to take a few yards off when I have it teed up just above the grass.,sports
Haha exactly. Funny how that works. Same with baseball. I need to tell myself before every swing in golf and baseball to keep my eye on the ball.,sports
"Follow-up question to that. After keeping your eye on the ball when you tee off, should you continue to keep your eye on the ball as it goes into the water hazard, or can you look back down and start teeing up your mulligan?",sports
"Note: Keeping your eye on the ball does NOT mean don't move your head.

&#x200B;

Trying to keep your head COMPLETELY still whilst every other part of your body is moving is damn-near impossible.",sports
"I do a ton of practice swings before hand. Its all about developing that mental image of where the ball is, and where my swing will go.

I'm looking so hard at the ball I'm practically looking through it, once I place it on the tee.

...Then of course the ball falls of the tee or something breaking my mental focus.",sports

Right? I fact I was going to driver home later today and polish up my 6 and 7 woods!,sports
"Kudos to you one being comfortable with that. Some of my buddies go that route too, but I need the visual cue of it sitting on top of the grass to inform the extension on my arms at the top of my backswing and the beginning of my downswing. I'll shift the ball in my stance or shorten my backswing and follow through to take some off. If I am in a gap distance I'm short of, I'll go up a club and do the same thing. I'm not comfortable enough on the course to up my swing speed, because I use currently use my range time to work on other areas. I'm sure this golf nerd talk on reddit is like hearing your coworker talk about their fantasy team.",sports
"I was gonna comment it's the same with tennis but honestly I think it's the same with any object related sport. Watch the ball, follow through, and look where you want it to land.",sports
Usually then I only look for the beer angel hoping she stops by haha,sports
That's not a good idea you should keep your head up to allow a full shoulder turn. If your chin is tucked in your shoulder turn will be restricted. A good set up is criminally underrated for amateur golfers.,sports
Holy shit I have been using this app for years and never knew I could do that.  Thank ya kindly,sports

Counter explanation: he missed completely,sports
"Bullshit, no one lies on the internet!",sports
"Not sure why I'm being down voted.

If this guy managed to make contact with the ball, he would have either ended up hitting a hosel rocket, or a crowning achievement. Both have the potential to damage a club.",sports
Not sure why you were downvoted. I also struggle to hit my irons off the tee. It’s purely a mental thing. I hit the ground at the tee box to get a small bump and place my ball on that.,sports
Pretty sure he just means going completely under the ball not hitting it.  I haven't golfed in a decade (scoliosis surgery) so I don't remember if that's even possible unless you are using old style clubs that are like a inch tall...... If he doesn't mean that tho then ya definitely lie.,sports
Even with a small club a wooden tee wouldnt stay put after being hit,sports
That's too bad. You should get back out there. My daughter had the same surgery five years ago (two rods and 20 screws) and recently joined her high school golf team. You can do it.,sports
That's what I'm saying.  I think he means 3 times he swung completely under the ball and the tee went and the ball dropped straight down.,sports
Unless something goes wrong and he ends up worse off of course,sports
"Yeah if he means this than its totally possible.  I've seen guys do it before.  I think everyone, myself included, thinks he meant he did exactly what happened in this video but with wooden tees.",sports
Anybody that watched that horrible football should get paid.,sports

"Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" policy called for all people who crossed the border illegally to be prosecuted, and therefore, every single family that crossed the border was separated. This resulted in thousands of families to be wrongly separated last year.

Obama did not do this. Obama, and Bush before him, separated families when the parent was suspected to be a child trafficker. They did not separate families for simply crossing the border.

With the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, Trump's administration abused an aspect of the Flores settlement to commit acts of cruelty.

Sometimes, separation of family units is necessary to ensure safety of the children, but it shouldn’t be needlessly abused.",politics
"It's amazing to see conservatives still trying to compare unaccompanied minors and cases of children being seperated from possible traffickers to deliberate and systematic separation after trump's recent blatant lie. ""I'm the one that stopped it"" bullfuckingshit. We've seen the memos. Your own people have gone on record stating otherwise. 

The hilarious part is that they actually let some some slip through because the traffickers forged their info and republicans tried to use that as a GOTCHA against democrats, ignoring that they also tracked them down, prosecuted said traffickers and provided restitution to the children and families affected by it.

The majority of children accompanied by their parents were NOT separated because the adults were not detained while waiting for their hearing

BUT, The difference is that the Trump Administration made it a point to detain and separate ALL children who came with adults (including ripping an 8 month old nursing baby) and it was no secret that it was intended as a Deterrent.

The Trump administration went further in declaring the newly separated children as ""unaccompanied minors"" (despite having arrived with parents or family) and thus not required to be reunited within a certain amount of time as the Law (or at least the court ordered opinion of the law) demanded.

There are Thousands of immigrant children who will never see their parents again due to this policy and the equally heartless other policies who would have otherwise been reunited with minimal difficulty under the Obama Administration policy.",politics

"""Weaponized"" is absolutely the right word.

They're not just gonna come to your town fresh out of the concentration camps ready to pick fruit for 7 bucks an hour. Because they're not going to release anyone from the camps who they haven't already beat, raped, or sickened to the point where cities will have no choice but to spend money taking care of people whose trauma will forever prevent them from being able to successfully integrate into society.

Take the School-to-Prison pipeline. Now take away the schools, and now apply it to people who've spent their lives fleeing American-funded narcoterrorism. Then take away any semblance of civil rights, take away the lawyers, take away the family support networks. 

**Take away their parents. Take away the very memory of ever having a parent.**

A lot of you still think this is some small deal that you can dismiss with a cute little remark like ""Sure! We love immigrants! Send them to my city.""

You're in for a nasty surprise. There's a deeper playbook to this whole operation. 

Remember, this is the same administration that created an ""Immigrant Crime List"". 

They want to release only the worst examples, and if they don't come into our country broken, they'll *break* them in the camps until they look the way they want immigrants to look like in front of the camera.

Now, look at the state of the American media and ask yourself: Will they fall for it?",politics

"Russia has been driving weaponized immigration with the refugee crisis in Europe, that much of our senior military leadership agrees is explicitly intentional and strategic. Obviously the US situation is very different in a number of ways, but exploiting progressive and welcoming countries' or cities' liberal immigration policies is something that has been quite effective in other parts of the world [source](https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Russia_Refugee_05-28-18.pdf)",politics

"Many people seem to think that CT is harboring fugitives in ""sanctuary cities"" and stopping ICE from doing their jobs.  I think it's important to provide sources that dispute these claims and so I'm going to try and do just that in case someone comes in here saying the Mayor of Hartford will just protect these illegal immigrants.

Just under four years ago CT passed the TRUST Act-This bill was passed by the CGA and signed into law by Malloy on June 25th, 2013.  [You can find a summary of the law here.](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/SUM/2013SUM00155-R02HB-06659-SUM.htm)  

The key components to me are the following:

>the act prohibits detaining the person unless the officer determines that specified public safety risk factors exist.

> If the person is to be detained, the officer must inform ICE that he or she will be held for up to 48 hours

> If ICE fails to take custody of the person within 48 hours, the officer must release the individual. 

>The act prohibits holding a person for longer than 48 hours solely on the basis of a civil immigration detainer under any circumstances.

Many argue that Malloy has said the state will go out of it's way to protect illegal immigrants and will make ICE's job harder.  [However, according to an article released this week, CT is actually sharing a tremendous amount of information with ICE through a program called COLLECT.](http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/22/14692842/ice-immigration-trump-data-connecticut-california)  

Currently- COLLECT gives ICE access to all of the following data streams;

-State DMV Data

-Court Data

-Probation Information

-Protective Orders

-Boating, Hunting, fishing and other license data

In regards to sanctuary cities since that has come up quite often.  I suggest people read up on the legal frameworks(constitutionality) and understand the federalism arguments around allocating local resources to help the feds do their jobs.  [You can read about that here.](http://www.jurist.org/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php)

I always think these articles from JURIST.org do a great job of providing a baseline of constitutionality on the issue of ""Sanctuary Cities."" I suggest people read these as background before engaging in the debate especially as it relates to any ""sanctuary state"".

[Article 1-""Sanctuary Cities"" to Find Sanctuary in the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts](http://www.jurist.org/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php)

[Article 2-The Discussion People AREN'T Having About Sanctuary Cities](http://www.jurist.org/hotline/2017/08/Colin-Whitlow-sanctuary-cities.php)

[Article 3-Federal judge rules for Philadelphia in 'sanctuary city' funding case](http://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/11/federal-judge-rules-for-philadelphia-in-sanctuary-city-funding-case.php)


I also find this academic paper from University of San Fran-Law Professor- Bill Ong Hing to be quite good regarding its sourcing and connections to the Constitution.
[Immigration Sanctuary Policies: Constitutional and Representative of Good Policing and Good Public Policy](http://www.law.uci.edu/lawreview/vol2/no1/hing.pdf)

A reminder that there is a huge difference between states being non-cooperative and actively blocking the Feds. This distinction is incredibly important to the constitutionality of all of this.

While illegal immigration is an issue facing all states and if you want more details on CT's situation I suggest you look at Pew Research Center's work on the topic.  The current mainstream debate raging between the feds and CT over immigration seems to be lacking many details.  The debate in our own state on the legality of these issues and how policy is being enforced daily needs to be much clearer to the public.",politics

If they really want to make their contribution worthwhile, give advantage to those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, regardless of race. I understand the intent was not based off my former sentence, but rather for blacks only, as the school was built off their ancestors labor.

"> The Republicans’ data on voters from the 2018 midterms showed that coverage of pre-existing medical conditions was the top issue of concern. But here they face a serious disadvantage: they have no health care plan of their own.

> But they have been testing messaging on health care with likely voters in the 16 states they believe will be the most competitive in 2020. These include ones Mr. Trump narrowly won like Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida, as well as those he won by larger margins but have tilted more Democratic lately, like Arizona and North Carolina. The R.N.C. found that when voters were told that “Medicare for all” would eliminate private insurance and create a government-run system paid for by higher taxes, independents, married women and union members disliked the idea by wide margins. Among married women alone, nearly 60 percent disapproved.

"laws change as society changes. Laws are created by people's desire to allow what is ""good"" and acceptable in modern ""society"" and what should be ""punished, or bad"" in modern society, being guided by the constitution. Just because some laws were created does not mean they were ""good"" laws. It just means for that particular time, that particular action was legal. Slavery was legal, and now it is not. Women could not vote, now they can. Just because some people are allowed to do ""something"" does not make that ""something"" right or wrong, it all depends on what the current law is. This is why it is so important to vote and hound your congressman to represent the voice of their constituents, and not travel all over the country or out of the country making appearances and shows that do not support their constituents. I am not here to argue the moral validity of abortion, my point is that laws change, and change rather frequently in relation to the human existence, and fairly frequently in the course of American history.",politics

There are states where the Republicans are able to sufficiently suppress the Democratic vote with bad laws and propaganda to eke out narrow victories as they did in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 

The Republicans understand they can have full voter participation and still lose.  So they concentrate their efforts on voter suppression strategies.  The Democrats suffer from several vulnerabilities which the party refuses to even acknowledge, much less address.  The Republicans have and will continue to take advantage of those vulnerabilities so long as those weaknesses exist.  It doesn't take much effort to make the Democrats stay home on election day.

So he’s throwing some bombs into the building.” Easier to remove the wreckage than a well-functioning institution.

Trump knows low interest rates make stocks go up, and other than that he vaguely knows The Fed has enormous influence on the economy. So it's the perfect foil: he can scream at it to lower interest rates, get the short term benefit if it does, and be able to blame it for the recession he caused with insane fiscal and trade policy if it doesn't.

“One piece of this that’s important to keep in context is that you always see this kind of defection between a primary and a general election. In 2008, you saw a lot of Hillary Clinton voters who ended up backing John McCain — so it's not abnormal to see this kind of thing. And more of them did so in 2008 than this time”

The study that shows the 25% of Hillary voters going on to vote McCain? It addressed the discrepancy you did and addressed it:

>this is different from exit poll results, which report only 16 percent of Clinton supporters voting for McCain versus 83 percent for Obama. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the exit poll question was *asked only to Democrats* and was based on whom they wanted to win the primary, not on whether they actually voted in the nomination contest. Moreover, because the question is asked after the general election, there may be over-reporting of support for the winning candidate

From *your article* in the last paragraph read this:

>Exit polling also showed that *Democrats* who supported Sen. Hillary Clinton during the primaries overwhelming voted for Obama in the general election, 84 percent to 15 percent for McCain. 

As to the percentages of which Bernie voters identified as what? I have a link for that too. Every single respondant from pink to red would have been excluded from the exit polls you pretend tells ""the real story"".

So if there are ""real bad hombres"" (there's always going to be a few, not as many as Trump things, but a few) in the groups sent there, they will be more likely to get ratted on by members of the community where they land.

It's the exact same thing he did at the border. Shutting down legal points of entry, reducing immigration judges and processing staff, so that the few remaining points of entry began to clog up. Crowds of desperate people began to gather, and it inevitably became violent.

He’s not. He just wants to make it someone else’s problem. And he will use this policy as an excuse to increase ICE presence in sanctuary cities.,politics

Quite a confusing proposal. Granted I have done zero research around it.",politics
Somehow I think scattering a bunch of detained immigrants across America is somehow a bad idea if your goal is to crack down on immigration; unless your idea is to spread those immigrants far and wide,politics
"Granted neither has Trump. He is claiming to just dump a bunch of detained immigrants into sanctuary cities, not sure how that could be taken any other way than he would be releasing them. Maybe he just wants to put them on display but it sure seems like he wants them in the cities themselves, you can’t release criminals unless you are breaking the law, so logically this is a move for full amnesty unless he admits criminal intent.",politics

Don’t understand him pushing for open borders furthers that point but let’s what his base has to say about this idea,politics
"How could he release criminals though? Wouldn’t that be illegal and dangerous? Logically he would have to claim full amnesty just to be able to release them, otherwise he would have prior criminal intent to harm American citizens. Either the President calling for amnesty for the illegal immigrants and criminals prior to release or he is claiming that there is no emergency at the border and they are in fact legal asylum seekers. Otherwise he is advocating for criminal abuse of power",politics
" You're right about all of that, but unfortunately most people won't think that far into it. 

Hopefully I'm just cynical though, and we'll see the majority of folks realize all of that too.",politics

Edit: to be clear, I’m not at all saying I want them deported/detained. The people coming here seeking asylum absolutely deserve to be given asylum. We have a humanitarian responsibility to help them, and this administration has been treating them like animals. Now they’re being treated like weapons. Except, if Trump is to be taken at his stupid fucking word, he’s unleashing what he considers to be dangerous people within the continental US. They can go wherever they want at that point.

But there's a reason prisoners in these camps are being ripped from their families, beaten, abused, raped, impregnated, denied abortions, and allowed to go without medical treatment. There's a reason they're deliberately maximizing the trauma inflicted upon them. There's a reason they're keeping track of little girl's periods, and disappearing them to be trafficked.

There's a reason they aren't already just bussing them to San Francisco after catching them at the border, and it sure as hell ain't ""processing"" because they're not keeping any actual data. The immigrants were *already* trying to go to the sanctuary cities in the first place, why spend all this money and political capital on the middleman at all?

They're doing this to create a permanently scarred population in order to ENSURE that releasing them harms blue states.

They want TV cameras pointing at American ghettos full of dispossessed victims.

This isn't a gamble for Trump. He gets to unilaterally decide who gets released, remember? He's not going to release anyone who he isn't 100% certain will strain the system, in the specific visible way he wants them to strain it.

"CDA 230?  From the EFF:

>Section 230 says that **""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider"" [\(47 U.S.C. § 230\)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230)**. In other words, online intermediaries that host or republish speech are protected against a range of laws that might otherwise be used to hold them legally responsible for what others say and do. The protected intermediaries include not only regular Internet Service Providers (ISPs), but also a range of ""interactive computer service providers,"" including basically any online service that publishes third-party content. Though there are important exceptions for certain criminal and intellectual property-based claims, CDA 230 creates a broad protection that has allowed innovation and free speech online to flourish.

>This legal and policy framework has allowed for YouTube and Vimeo users to upload their own videos, Amazon and Yelp to offer countless user reviews, craigslist to host classified ads, and Facebook and Twitter to offer social networking to hundreds of millions of Internet users. Given the sheer size of user-generated websites (for example, Facebook alone has more than 1 billion users, and YouTube users upload 100 hours of video every minute), it would be infeasible for online intermediaries to prevent objectionable content from cropping up on their site. Rather than face potential liability for their users' actions, most would likely not host any user content at all or would need to protect themselves by being actively engaged in censoring what we say, what we see, and what we do online. **In short, CDA 230 is perhaps the most influential law to protect the kind of innovation that has allowed the Internet to thrive since 1996.**

>The first study, published by the libertarian Cato Institute in February, examines criminal conviction data for 2015 provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety. It found that native-born residents were much more likely to be convicted of a crime than immigrants in the country legally or illegally.

>""As a percentage of their respective populations, there were 56 percent fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of native-born Americans in Texas in 2015,"" author Alex Nowrasteh writes. ""The criminal conviction rate for legal immigrants was about 85 percent below the native-born rate.""

>The data shows similar patterns for violent crimes such as homicide and property crimes such as larceny. The study did find that immigrants in the United States illegally were more likely than native-born people to be convicted of ""gambling, kidnapping, smuggling, and vagrancy."" But as those crimes represented just 0.18 percent of all convictions in Texas that year, they had little effect on overall crime rates.

>Another study, published in March in the journal Criminology, looked at population-level crime rates: Do places with higher percentages of undocumented immigrants have higher rates of crime? The answer, as the chart above shows, is a resounding no.

>States with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tended to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares in the years 1990 through 2014. ""Increases in the undocumented immigrant population within states are associated with significant decreases in the prevalence of violence,"" authors Michael T. Light and Ty Miller found.

>The most recent IRS data, from 2015, shows that the agency received 4.4 million income tax returns from workers who don’t have Social Security numbers, which includes a large number of undocumented immigrants. That year, they paid $23.6 billion in income taxes. That doesn’t even include workers who paid taxes with fake Social Security numbers on their W-2 forms, which is also common.

Reminder:

The Washington Examiner isn't a real newspaper. It has no subscribers. It's given away for free. It loses money every year.

The writers, staff, facilities, printers and distributors are all paid for by billionaire Phillip Anschutz. Basically, it's his personal, political agenda blog - that he bought a whole newspaper to publish.

Politico describes the Examiner as ""a megaphone for Anschutz's right-wing views on taxes, national security and President Barack Obama"".
 
Anschutz:

	•	Helped fund the start up of the Discovery Institute - one of the leading think tanks challenging evolutionary science.[4]

	•	Greenpeace notes that media companies owned by Anschutz figure prominently in the denial of climate science and the promotion of climate-change skepticism.[5]

	•	The Anschutz Foundation funded the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a think tank that opposes labor unions.

	•	Anschutz was one of the primary supporters of Colorado’s 1992 anti-gay Proposition 2.

	•	Anschutz contributes to: American Enterprise Institute, Americans for Prosperity, Cato Institute, Freedom Works, etc.

	•	Since 2008, the Anschutz Foundation has funded the Mission America Foundation, a far-right organization whose president considers homosexuality to be a “deviance”[9] and has railed against the removal of HIV-based travel restrictions, warning that “‘the U.S.’s liberal homosexual culture’ will attract HIV-positive immigrants.”[10]

	•	Anschutz's Regal Cinemas was a leader in businesses that rebelled against Obamacare. After handing out 6-figure bonuses to the Board, they cut back their employees hours to avoid having to offer them health insurance.

	•	A natural gas exploration company owned by Anschutz, the Anschutz Exploration Corporation, sued the town of Dryden, N.Y., over the town’s regulation of hydraulic fracturing,[11] or “fracking,” a process that has been blamed for severe environmental damage.[12] A judge upheld the town’s ban, but Anschutz’s lawyers have pledged to continue their claim.
 
The extra irony here is that the Anschutz company is now mainly in entertainment. Chances are you've given them your money. They own Regal Theaters, MLS and NHL teams, dozens of major venues across the world, the ticketing service AXS, and Goldenvoice, — which puts on Stagecoach, Firefly, Hangout and Coachella festivals.

Also according to trump, migrants coming across the border are dangerous criminal animals that seek only to sell drugs, rape, and murder.

trump wants to release people that (by his own logic, not reality) are dangerous criminals into places that are (by his own logic, not reality) already dangerous.

They excel at one thing, and one thing only: Cherry-picking.

They're going to *cherry-pick* the immigrants that get sent to these cities so that their arrival causes as much chaos, panic, fear, and media frenzy as possible. They are going to do it in the most destructive way they can think of.

And the ones who don't fit the stereotype of the lazy criminal rapist, or irresponsible single mom?

Well...they'll *create them*. The camps are only there to disconnect people from their families, their support networks, their education, their mental stability, and in so doing *sabotage* their future ability to integrate into society. 

So that when they are released, they're not going to be the friendly neighborhood immigrant with the taco trucks. 

They're going to be wrecks. 

I promise you this: Your city, no matter how liberal, will never be able to muster enough sympathy, patience, perspective, and money to help the people whose lives have been deliberately destroyed by this administration.
