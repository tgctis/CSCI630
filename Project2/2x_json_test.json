    "Not to downplay the painter's skill, which is excellent, but there is a lot of surrounding context cluing in who the subject is.", 
    "I bid $3.50 and one penny.", 
    "I disagree. The runner on 3rd made a mistake as well. \n\nFreeze it at 4 seconds. At that point the 1st baseman decided that it wasn't worth throwing Hamilton out because the runner at 3rd was going to go home as soon as he threw it. Also at that point in time it was clear the runner was going to make it to second and the runner on 3rd was still close enough to possibly make it back in time.", 
    "That's called the Spicy Pickle... \ud83e\udd52", 
    "same I would buy if the price was right",

    "Do you know what it\u2019s called? It seems like it would really help.", 
    "Hi pretty proud, you are talented in your own way", 
    "Let me guess, about 10 days??", 
    "I think he was considering taking third knowing that it\u2019s so unlikely to get out of a run-down. If he takes third and the other runner does make it safely back to third then he still gets to stay on the bag. Only the other runner would be out.", 
    "In the hole!!!", 
    "Woah that's really impressive", 
    "Thank you. To a non-American, this now makes (some) sense after your explanation.", 
    "$4.00 and ONE. PENNY.", 
    "Holy fucking shit your dad is talented. He's like what would happen if Turner and Sargent had a 21st century baby that used small canvases", 
    "I would know 100% by the face alone", 
    "I\u2019ll start at tree fiddy", 
    "This is going to make the top page.", 
    "5.00", 
    "That\u2019s me in the background in the yellow shirt.", 
    "Are you serious?", 
    "Chopsdix is the gawd damn lochness monsta!", 
    "I'm need about tree fiddy.", 
    "That\u2019s a weird ass painting style but great painting.", 
    "Do you think it's supposed to be a mystery?", 
    "I regret I only have but 1 upvote to give!", 
    "I\u2019d rather not be reminded of that.", 
    "Are you the Arsenal FC management?", 
    "Beautiful. He should do one of the security guard tripping tiger next. Wonder if that guy still has a job...", 
    "Its a brilliant picture but you don't know if you know by the face alone, you may think that but that's because you know it is him before you got to the face. It's like those trick picture/drawings that you spend ages looking at wondering what it is then you see what it is and can't ever unsee it.   \n    \nTbh, i think there is a decent chance i might have got it from the face alone but ill never know for certain because as i said above I saw who it was before being challenged to do that.", 
    "Hmm which sub will you repost to within the next 24 hours?", 
    "Im pretty stoned so this is probably retarded but does our mind kind of fill in details. Im sure we can all picture this exact scene and tiger\u2019s face as well. Im not trying to downplay the painting, it\u2019s just crazy how much expression you can see from that amount of detail", 
    "Where\u2019s Michael Phelps?", 
    "Oh they were already likely losing once the runner from third put himself in the run down. \n\nMy statement was from the perspective of what the runner on second should have done once the runner from 3rd was already in the run down.", 
    "It's called a painter's hand rest. Although they're made commercially, I use a bent metal ruler to accomplish the same. It's basically just anything flat that you can bend which will then rest on top of the canvas and still be long enough for you to reach what you're painting when you anchor your palm on it. Although I'm sure commercial solutions will provide a better experience, I haven't had any issues with my homemade solutions.\n\nEDIT: In the case of the painter's rest he's using here (beautiful painting, btw) - the length is adjustable via the butterfly nut which is removed, the metal hangar is then extended or retracted to the appropriate position, and the butterfly nut is resecured - hence all the holes in the piece of wood.", 
    "I am Tiger Woods. Message me. I'd like to buy it.", 
    "Your dad is super talented, tell him so a lot!", 
    "Meh. It wasn't this time. If they played this series 100 times, it's not like the Blazers would win them all or something. It was a good shot, but it wasn't destiny.", 
    "How is this style of painting called? I like it a lot!", 
    "$5.00 and **ONE. PENNY.**", 
    "I don\u2019t understand how people can be so talented- taking about the artist not Tiger", 
    "Clothes for me. Red top black pants? Tiger.", 
    "I love it. I want one!", 
    "I like you", 
    "Nice stuff.", 
    ">  The runner on 3rd made a mistake as well.\n\nAbsolutely he made a mistake but my comment was specifically from the perspective of the runner on second once the runner from 3rd was already in a run down.", 
    "That's the power of some artists. The implied image is sometimes more real than what is actually on the canvas. They have mastered the art of detail with subtlety.", 
    "okay wow \ud83d\udc40 ur dad didn\u2019t have to flex his skills on us like that\ud83d\udc95 \n\nobsessed \ud83d\ude3b", 
    "Yoooo", 
    "Ya now imagine that my entire life.", 
    "You're being downvoted but I agree. If he wasn't wearing the hat, that outfit, painted as a golfer, surrounded by spectators...\n\nBeautiful painting and amazing talent no doubt, but you really mean to tell me that a painting of a guy at a grocery store or something basic, wearing overalls etc., with that same face, would be distinguishable as Tiger Woods?", 
    "i hate that people can use blobs of paint for a face, and somehow they perfectly still look like faces just because the right colors/shading LIKE HOW DO YOU DO THAT", 
    "Hi pretty proud. I'm Dad", 
    "That's a man's leg and him leaning on his umbrella.", 
    "I never blamed the refs. I think they made the right call. The rule is dumb.", 
    "The creases in his pants are amazing", 
    "Sometimes called a mahlstick. See pinstripers use them a bit..", 
    "Wow! You can be proud of your dad. Would love to have such a beauty hanging on my wall, great stuff!", 
    "I legit thought he painted with his pinky.", 
    "That's really cool, almost like looking through a window on a rainy day. I like unique styles like this, props to your father!",

    "God Dam!", 
    "God dam!", 
    "Why are both teams wearing the same color? That was hard to figure out.", 
    "Nah, dude. This level of talent takes at least twice that much.", 
    "No if you look it's 1st and 3rd when the play begins. Once the guy coming home (stupid move) gets caught in the rundown his job is to stay alive long enough nough for the guy on 2nd to advance to 3rd. Everyone did a bad job.", 
    "idk, from what I've seen on tv, the EPL matches seem pretty tame. Mostly older folks in the crowds.", 
    "A stunning piece of work, masterful use of loose brushstrokes to denote depth!\n\nAlso the clever use of primary colours really makes Tiger pop out; it really draws your eye to the centre of the work, 10/10", 
    "Uphill both ways", 
    "Sounds like you know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019ll show him this. Thanks!", 
    "Not cool man... tigers are endangered", 
    "I like that his painters pallets are paper plates!\ud83d\udc4d", 
    "Holy hell, if I was a billionaire I'd throw everything at that picture", 
    "Your father is quite the talented painter.", 
    "That is a really cool painting!", 
    "where is the tigers face? it looks like a golf picture", 
    "Wow really cool!", 
    "If I was a tiger super fab, is pay a lot of money for this.", 
    "How?? It baffles me people are this talented.", 
    "Everyone should have a security guard that specializes in lower leg takedowns", 
    "I love it. It looks like it\u2019s pouring rain.", 
    "Was he wearing patent leather?", 
    "Amazing", 
    "[Word cloud out of all the comments.](https://i.imgur.com/o6kN0Yh.png)\n\nFun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit. Enjoy", 
    "I will take 10!", 
    "You are indeed a dad", 
    "It\u2019s just hard to define \u201cbest play\u201d because so many time someone misses a lay up and 3 pointers are becoming higher percentage shots every year. ( or maybe players are just chucking up shots more every year)", 
    "Alright since no one else is, I'll just say it: this looks kind of fake.", 
    "I like the DeAndre Baker write-up. I would love to get him at 17 for my Giants", 
    "I don\u2019t have to be Mike Trout to tell you that was some stupid ass base running", 
    "I thought he was finger painting with his pinky at first...", 
    "Beautiful! I notice the paper plates. Cute. Resourceful.", 
    "\u201cThat\u2019s easy to remember.\u201d \n\nLove IT Crowd and love the reference.", 
    "And there's no telling how much electrical prodding it took to get that trick right.", 
    "Oh, I thought you were gonna say something about his long fingernails.", 
    "Thanks, I\u2019ll display it proudly! \ud83d\udc4d", 
    "Yup. Or if he had an HQ image of this we could buy a single reproduction license for(maybe through a 3rd party print maker) and have it printed out on canvas, that\u2019d be pretty sweet. I\u2019m saving this post to look into down the road. There\u2019s too much good there for Dad not to capitalize on.", 
    "Sounds like a schrute boy", 
    "his heirarchy of detail is very cool, it directs your eye around the painting. first you see tigers face, then the people behind him, then the tree, then back to tigers face. you pretty much ignore the background because there's no detail at all.", 
    "Get this in front of Tigers people. Pretty sure he would give you a nice chunk of change for it....\n\nFantastic work!", 
    "The paint on the plates looks like the same style as the art itself. And yet I can tell it's Tiger plain as day. This is wild.", 
    "Thats kinda like saying Avengers endgame is superior to other movies because a trillion ppl about to watch it.", 
    "It's a Schooner.", 
    "You can also tell who it is by his dark skin and golf club", 
    "Focus.....FOCUS!!!!!!", 
    "The tournament ended 10 days ago lol", 
    "Brings back a lot of memories of Tiger\u2019s greatest moments.", 
    "You should try to get Tiger to sign it.", 
    "Oh, shit. I completely missed the joke.", 
    "Is your dad Brent Bengor?", 
    "Uhh congrats dad!", 
    "It looks like a photo was printed on the surface and then was painted over, rather than a freehand painting.", 
    "That painting is a depiction of what it is like to watch The Masters on satellite TV during a rainstorm.", 
    "Damn", 
    "I too would like to know", 
    "Absolutely amazing.\n\nPlease tell your dad he is amazing from ad random redditor.", 
    "Welcome to Portland haha", 
    "So Tiger Woods was posing for how long?", 
    "Lol it happens", 
    "Holy that's amazing", 
    "As a non-American who\u2019s lived in the US for 20 years, I sympathize - it\u2019s taken me years to figure out the intricacies of baseball (and I\u2019m not at 100% by any means) and that\u2019s with an American wife who is a huge fan. She feels the same way about cricket...", 
    "I could'nt really care less about golf and Tiger Woods but as your Dad is amazing!", 
    "I'm proud of my grandkids for not pissing in my damn pool all last Summer. I am opening it up again Saturday and I'm going to pee on any little fucker who tries too urinate in it",

What's the reason behind taking these rights away? Whatever your answer is (punishment, separation from society, etc.) then apply the same logic to voting. If you think jail is punishment, not voting can be viewed as punishment. If you think jail should be to keep dangerous people from society, then the reason would be they're too dangerous to be given the right to participate via voting.

    ">Harris is a good example because I like her a lot more than most progressives seem to. There's nothing in her history which screams \"I'm not a progressive!\" So I'm happy to take her at face value, for now. \n\nHarris is currently a reluctant #3 for me. The standout strikes against being a progressive for me are: Going against the opinions of her staff as attorney general to refuse to prosecute Steve Mnuchin. Saying she supports Medicare for all only to have her aides walk it back. Laughing about how her truancy law would be unpopular in San Francisco (subtext being because it is considered to be so progressive). The meetings she had with Clinton's Hamptons donors prior to becoming a candidate. All of that being said, she's supported progressive legislation during her time in the Senate unambiguously as far as I'm aware.\n\n>At the very least, I fully believe that if Congress could put a Medicare for All/Green New Deal bill onto President Harris's desk that she would sign it in an instant. Of course I'd rather support a president who would have been pushing the bill every step along the way, but at the end of the day we're counting hairs.\n\nI don't think it's just hair counting at all. I find it highly unlikely that Medicare for All is brought to the desk of any president who isn't using the bully pulpit to push for it. The effort for Medicare for All is being opposed by extremely well funded lobbyists from two of the most powerful industries in this country. Only with the free media coverage afforded by the bully pulpit can we hope to compete, in my opinion.\n\n>If it somehow comes between a choice of President Kamela Harris or Unsuccessful Candidate Warren, I'd obviously rather support Harris - so electibility and continuity mean a lot to me (which is also why I'm holding off on donating until the DNC)\n\nThe choice would be between president Kamala Harris and president Elizabeth Warren actually.
