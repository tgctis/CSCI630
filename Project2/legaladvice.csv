Title: **Hit and Run**

Original Post: 

> (Asking for a friend) 
> So, two weeks ago a friend of mine purchased a classic used car. Yesterday while he was backing out of a driveway a woman drove right into his bumper/the back of his car. He saw her before she hit him so he stopped backing out before she reached him but she still hit him and kept driving. Thankfully he has evidence that she hit him  and his boss (who witnessed the whole thing) knows who the person is. My friend actually found the woman to talk to but she flat out refused to give him any insurance info.
> What should he do? 
> 
> The estimated damage on the car is roughly $5000.

Title: **My student loans appear as “charge off/collections”**

Original Post: 

> I’m on mobile, so I apologize for formatting. 
> 
> I checked my credit report today and saw that my accounts open with the government for my student loans (about $5,000) had appeared as “closed” and that the explanation is “charge off/sent to collections.” When I click on the account info, it does show that I have a balance with them, but the account containing the debt itself is closed. I owed the school itself about $2,000 on top of my loans (charges that should not be there and are the fault of damage caused by my roommate, but I’m done trying to challenge that) and that was sent to a collections agency that shows the debt itself is from the university and not the government for student loans. Today I got an updated review of my credit that shows my credit score went up and that the collections account had been removed. There’s no account for collections on the report showing that it has been closed, written off, etc., it just looks like it’s completely disappeared. 
> 
> I’m hesitant to get in touch with someone over my student loans because I don’t want them to “re-open” my loan accounts or something. What does the status that it’s closed mean? Do I still owe them money? Would they be able to re-open my account if I contacted them and force me to pay the amount I owe?

Title: **[UPDATE]Bought a wedding dress from china and got scammed!**

Original Post: 

> Update in case someone is interested or for future reference, if someone finds themselves in a similar situation.
> 
> &amp;#x200B;
> 
> PayPal decided the case against me for the second time.  I called them and let them know that the seller did not give me a valid return address, but they did not reopen the case.  Their decision is final.  They all agree with me that I was scammed and that it isn't right that I have to pay more than $180.00 to send the dress back to a seller who scammed me without a valid address. But when push comes to shove, they consistently decide against me, despite the fact that I have documentation proving everything I say.  I also told them that I was instructed yesterday by PayPal itself to contact my bank and start a chargeback claim and I asked them if they would ban me because of that.  They said they wouldn't and that they only ban people who do this habitually. So that's good news (maybe).
> 
> &amp;#x200B;
> 
> After PayPal decided the case against me, the seller contacted me, apologized, and told me they're issuing me a $150.00 refund but it would take several days to show on my account and that I please wait patiently.  I find this incredibly insulting (they have apologized and offered this refund several times before, I just don't ever get any refund), but $150.00 is definitely better than -$180, so if everything goes well, I will withdraw the  chargeback claim and just pay the price for being stupid, I guess.
> 
> &amp;#x200B;
> 
> Here's where it gets confusing again: I called the bank to inform them of all that, and to ask them whether or not I should close the claim and they told me absolutely not.  They told me I'm not the first this has happened to and that I should not close the claim. We should wait and see if the refund shows up first, and then decide.  I thought they would be eager to get this off their hands, but that's what their response to me was. They further instructed me to have no more contact with the seller at this point.  Does this sound right to you guys?
> 
> &amp;#x200B;
> 
> I'm concerned that this could be interpreted in different ways depending on who's looking into it.  They can assume I'm following their own instructions and waiting to see if the refund will show up, which is what I'm doing, but they can also assume that I'm trying to get the refund, plus the chargeback and still keep the dress, which is not what I'm trying to do.  I told the bank that and I did ask them to make a note of me informing them about this refund, just in case.
> 
> &amp;#x200B;
> 
> So this is where I stand now.  I will make updates once something else happens.  If you're still reading this and have any input, it is much appreciated, please don't hesitate to reply.  I'm in way over my head on this one and I don't really know what I'm doing at all.  Thank you all.

Title: **I lost $1600 on car insurance for a car I no longer own. I asked the broker to cancel the insurance in person when transferring the ownership, but they did not.**

Original Post: 

> June  2018 I bought a car and began a month-by-month insurance plan with $200  payments. In August 2018, however, I sold it to my Father. We went to  the local Sussex Insurance and asked to transfer the car into his name,  cancel my insurance, and start a plan for my father. Now, this was my  first car, so I had no idea what the necessary steps were. I signed the  transfer paper and they started helping him with the plan. After 10  minutes or so, they said we were done and we left. Fast forward to April  2nd, 2019. I'm about to pay rent and utilities, but realize I'm $200  short. I check my payment history - nothing. Throughout the last few  months, which I had budgeted to give me about $1600 breathing room, I  was frequently noticing I was shorter than I should be, but chalked it  up to poor budgeting and excessive food/coffee/alcohol purchases.  Turns  out, my transaction history (I never checked because I only make small  purchases) had a $200 ICBC charge every month for 8 months. Sussex never  cancelled my insurance despite the transfer of ownership and asking the  employee to cancel my plan. Only now after talking to another broker do  I know that I have to hand in the plates and sign the cancellation  document. At the time, the Sussex employee acknowledged my wish to  cancel and then proceeded to help my father set up his plan. ICBC  doesn't want to refund me anything. Sussex has no file on the  cancellation because they never started one. Is there anything I can do  to remedy this? I just lost $1600 on insurance for a car I do not own. I  did just cancel at the other broker I mentioned.

Original Post: 

> Hi guys, to make a long story short my dog bit another dog's ear today. The owner took our info and took their dog to the vet, and of course I was expecting to pay the vet bills. Problem being that the owner is now saying that the vet said that ear injures will bleed for days and at first he said ""if I end up needing to hire a maid then we'll charge you for the cleaning"" and immediately after said ""I'll see how he does tonight but if I can't keep the bandage on him then I will just have to kennel him at the vet for a few days."" am I obligated to pay for a vet kennel stay??? I mean i could buy this guy a kennel and bring it to him, but he vet already declared that the dog is fine he's just going to bleed. Paying for an extended vet stay to avoid cleaning up blood from your house seems really unnecessary.

Title: **I got in a fender bender but it was just scratches on the other car and I got a reckless driving ticket**

Original Post: 

> I was at work about an hour before I got off and I got a call that I had got offered my dream job that I had worked so hard for. I was really excited and wanted to take my gf out to dinner and surprise her with the good news. On the way home I hit a spot that has normal stop and go traffic. Travelled same route home over 8 years. Well I was in the traffic I didn’t notice the car in front of me completely stopped (it wasn’t a sudden stop or anything) and when I noticed I slammed on my breaks and bumped the back of her car. The only damage on her car was scratches from my license plate from what I could tell. I wasn’t going fast or speeding. When the cop came he gave me a reckless driving because she was stopped. I told the cop I was excited cause I got that job and I just couldn’t stop in time. I also told him I can’t have this on my record at my new job so he said just ask for driving school. So I went ahead and just took the driving school cause I heard it looks better.I had never been to court so when I got there I thought you just plead not guilty so you could ask for driving school but the judge said they would have to subpoena the whiteness. I heard other people while waiting on my case plead no contest. I didn’t even know what that meant. When I go back to court should I plead no contest? Or should I stick with not guilty and tell them my story? I know he will see I have taken the driving school if I plead no contest. I’m just trying not to have a reckless. Also my driving record is great. +5 never had a speeding ticket. Only thing I have is a stop sign ticket from 5-6 years ago but I don’t know if he sees that.

I thought “just another fight”, and locked the door of the stall I was in, as there was no easy way out at the time. The two went at it, it was pretty rough, and eventually everyone filed out. Teachers came in shortly after to sweep the last of the kids out.

Title: **Suing my mother for property damage**

Original Post: 

> Hello everyone,
> 
> I'm currently 18 and moving out to college this coming fall. My mother and I just got into a fight, and the threat that she would destroy my belongings (mainly computer) is becoming a legitimate worry of mine. If she does happen to destroy it and I take her to court, do I have any chance of winning with testimony from my brother who is 14  (the threats have happened multiple times in front of him). Would I even gain anything if I still live under her household?

If you legitimately got discharged with a general over a medical condition, you should [file an appeal](http://arba.army.pentagon.mil/documents/dd0293.pdf) (PDF warning) and route it appropriately. The VA can assist with the paper work. You also should alert your Senators via constituent inquiry and request additional help and supervision over the process. 

I really think that you're fixated on the wrong thing. Whether they logged ice and IVs is totally irrelevant. It's arguable that omitting it from your record makes an argument for negligence even stronger. It's also arguable that negligence is **100% irrelevant** because you are processing a VA claim.

Title: **Disenfrancised vote because of a lack of parking?**

Original Post: 

> The voting precinct where I live is located in a large retirement community. There are several parking lots, but I took my mother to vote one year, and I had a hard time finding a space. When we left, I drove around the complex, and even in the back parking lots, a far walk from the voting booths, almost every parking space was full.
> 
> That, I think, was during a heated midyear election. I am concerned the 2020 election will be an absolute madhouse as pro-Trump and anti-Trump camps turn out in force. I do not think the retirement home will have enough parking. It is still a working retirement home with employees, visitors, and vendors. All of those people need parking spaces, too.
> 
> I brought up my concern with my county representative. I asked that the precinct be moved to the nearby park. There are more parking spaces, and plenty of voters from surrounding neighborhoods could *walk* to the polls without having to park at all.
> 
> Could this be considered disenfranchisement? It is not a matter of politics. I just want to be able to park when I go to vote.

Original Post: 

> Hello there! First time poster ever here. If this isn't the right sub for this, please tell me because I need answers from somewhere. And sorry if it gets too long!
> 
> My Stepfather was in a horrible car accident almost 20 years ago that resulted in him slamming head first into a tree and even dying for a few seconds. Because of this, he has horrible brain damage and half of his body aches all the time. He can still talk and walk but he's definitely not suited to be working anywhere. He filed for disability 17 years ago and has been waiting for it without any income. My mother has to support his medical stuff and her three children by herself, and what money she does make goes to bills. Is there anything we can do to get disability or at the very least speed things up? The really screwed up part is his dad got out of jail recently and filed for disability under the same attorney and got it within months! The other passenger of that car accident also has disability and has much less problems than my stepdad.
> I feel like the systems against us because we know so many people who abuse the disability system and we can't get what we need, and that 700 a month could change things extremely. We could finally get a car and not have to worry about feeding everyone. So is there a solution or are we stuck?
> Also he refuses to drop his attorney because he'll have to start all over and lose all the money he could get for waiting (if you don't know, the government pays you for all the months you've missed waiting for disability)

Title: **C&amp;D and then nothing**

Original Post: 

> I received a C&amp;D letter that came certified mail from my previous employer over half a decade ago.  It was sent because it was alleged I had stated information to others that violated my non-compete/non-disclosure. It was not a good situation to say the least. Since being sent the only correspondence I’ve had with them was to obtain a W2 the following year the letter was sent to me. The person who headed the HR division at the time asked for my address, but I was legitimately having postal issues and I had him send me the W2 via email. I’ve moved around a few times since the initial alleged indiscretion and never followed up about my address being changed as there was obviously no need to contact my former employer. I was always sure to update my address with the post office.
> 
> Fast forward almost 5 years and I’ve finally purchased a house and I’m really nervous that the only reason I was never served was because I couldn’t be found. The house is the first piece of property I’ve owned in my name (car is owned in my wife’s name). I’m scared that now a title search can be done to locate me and the small amount of assets I have will be exposed. What’s the realistic chance of this happening and should I do anything?I’m super paranoid about giving details of the indiscretion but if anyone needs them to let me know how bad it looks let me know.

Title: **Fired but employer has labeled it as Quitting. No longer able to apply for unemployment while job searching for security. Is there any legal action that can be persued?**

Original Post: 

> My cousin [no Reddit account] was recently terminated from a food making business we will call, Be Well. Prior to the termination, he had been taken off the original schedule because they were under the belief he quit. He didn't. He told the GM he closed his position and left 30min early. Later the next day after him seeing he is off the schedule, and hearing from others he quit, he contacted his GM and told them he didn't quit. They then re-add him to the schedule. Very soon after he receives word from his gf that her grandmother will be going through a very risky operation and would like him with her at the hospital. He then spent that time contacting everyone and anyone to cover him. Even his GM and the individual above him. A few hours before his shift, he is told if he doesn't show up for his shift, the owner stated, that he will be fired for a ""no call no show"". Now he has a text from his GM that he would be terminated. Not as a no call no show, just terminated. He then finds out, when grabbing his stuff he has been labeled as quitting. Now he cannot file for unemployment to help pay for his bills while he is applying as a cushion. Is there any legal action he can pursue for this?

Title: **My cousin works at the courthouse where I was sentenced and disclosed the results of my hearing to my mother with whom I do not speak to or want anything to do with. Is this a HIPAA violation? Can anything be done about this?**

Original Post: 

> My mom and I have an extremely toxic relationship and I did not intend on disclosing any information to her. I feel violated and her scathing text message saying I have a “wasted life” was not exactly the cherry on top of finding out about my sentencing and losing a promotion I worked so hard for. Any advice on how to move forward with this is more than appreciated.

Original Post: 

> My mother died back in September, and the executor has been preparing her house to be sold. Furniture and appliances were removed from the property and I have been informed that they were thrown out (I allowed them to be removed as I was under the impression I would begetting them back). The executor has offered to pay my brother and I back for the missing items using money from the trust. He and I are the only ones listed as trustees and all of the money is ultimately supposed to be going to us anyway.

> Am I wrong in thinking that the executor is a little crazy in trying to pay us back with what is ultimately our money?

Original Post: 

> I found an Instagram ad from a well known brand using a font that has to have a commercial license to be used in advertisement, and as not many people have actually purchased the license, I know they have not. This hasn’t happened before and I’m not sure if I should just politely email and ask them to remove it or something else, since their ad has been running for a bit. Any advice/ future advice if this happens again will be helpful!

Title: **Personal Injury tort case: Lawyer wants to drop the case after 10 years?**

Original Post: 

> This is in regards to my mother who was in a motor vehicle accident 10 years ago. 
> 
> She had an ongoing 'pain and suffering' case that her lawyers opened after a pre-trial settlement of around $50,000 back in 2014. 
> 
> At the time she was told she had a very strong case for pain and suffering and was given a pre-trial date to June, 2019. So fast forward to 2019 we received a letter from her lawyers saying that they don't believe she will be successful at trial and was given two options with pre-trial being just around the corner. She was told that if she is unsuccesful at trial she could be faced with costs of up to $200,000 for the defendants lawyers.  
> 
> These documents are;
> 
> Irrevocable direction (to stop suing the other party) 
> 
> Notice of Intent to appear in person
> 
> So acting on behalf of my mother I am communicating with her lawyers. I asked what changed since 2014 that they are bringing these issues up now. The lady I was emailing told me that insurance companies changed their policies since the case opened and no longer pay out money for cases similar to her and that she had two more accidents after this which are seen as more significant by the insurance companies.
> 
> She is very upset and is adamant that the justice system will not fail her and wants to step in front of a judge. But I am scared that if she goes by herself she has nothing in her hand as evidence (no documents) and basically has no experience in the justice system. She has all these ideas in her head that the judge will stand up for her and start questioning bother her lawyer and other side why it took so long, etc. 
> 
>  Also, I doubt we can find another lawyer on such short notice which is part of the reason I am mad that her lawyers are bringing up these issues now. 
> 
> She obviously doesn't want to sign anything but her lawyer said he will only show up to pre-trial if she signs the 'Notice of Intent to appear in person' form (which he promises he will not file until after they fail to reach a settlement at pre-trial). 
> 
> Sorry this is a long post. But my questions are basically 
> 
> 1. What is a court room procedure like for cases like this? Will the judge listen to her side of the story without any medical records in her hand available? (Also, how can she go about getting medical records from 10 years ago?)
> 
> 2. Will there be like duty counsel in court for people without representation? (I am asking this because for landlord/tenant disputes they were providing services like this)
> 
> 3. Also many people I talked to say lawyers are crooks and most likely made a deal under the table with each other to throw away the case. (I find this unlikely) but what are the chances of this happening?
